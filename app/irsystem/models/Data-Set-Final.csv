In reality, Ja Myung Go does not represent the drum but instead, is embodied by the Kingâ€™s daughter, Princess Ja Myung. Princess Ja Myung and Princess Nak-Rang are born on the same day and time to the same father but different mothers. It is predicted that one princess will become the nationâ€™s savior while the other will bring the entire nation down. Using her familyâ€™s powerful background, Princess Nak-Rangâ€™s mother successfully establishes her daughter as the savior princess while Princess Ja Myung, who is branded the princess of destruction, escapes death with the help of her mother and grows up among the common folk. When she learns of her true identity, Princess Ja Myung returns to her Kingdom, resulting in a new wave of internal politics and power struggles. Princess Ja Myung and Prince Hodong of the rival state of Goguryeo fall in love but fate has it that they cannot be together. Princess Nak-Rang, who is also in love with the Prince, willingly gives her nation up to him by destroying her Kingdomâ€™s mystical war drum. Princess Ja Myung, fighting to save her nation, finally pierces her sword towards her beloved Prince Hodongâ€¦</p><p><strong>Cast </strong></p><p><a href=""http://star.koreandrama.org/?p=376""

Weâ€™re talking body exchange, which has been done many times on the big screen, but rarely on Korean TV. The idea of Park Jin-Hee playing an Ajumma and Shim Hye-Jin going into sexy mode sounds just about right (the initial setup is the opposite, obviously), and if the script builds on the interesting outline, this could be fun."
1283,Look Back With a Smile,"['Comedy', 'sitcom']",KBS2,"Lee Duk Hwa is the iron-willed president of a private hospital. At home, he is similarly conservative and severe, stubbornly insisting that his word is law. In an era where young people believe in freedom of thought and speech, however, he finds it difficult to communicate with his children. A storm of problems gives him further headaches: his oldest son Sang Myun fails at his business yet again, and his seemingly perfect second daughter Seung Min suddenly insists on marrying a celebrity. At the end of the day, can he look back with a smile?"

I mean, heâ€™s got it all: heâ€™s good looâ€¦ OK, not really. But, hey, heâ€™s richâ€¦ at least inside. And despite his heavy Jeolla Province dialect, he certainly has many charms, itâ€™s just that heâ€™s too damn picky (or is it the other way around?)! But all of a sudden he finds his perfect girl, a 29 year old announcer (Park Sun-Young) who will rock his world. Man, I bet her parents will love her new conquest. Story has been done to death, but this being a Weekend Drama (more time to develop characters, less incentive to use educational â€˜shocking revelationsâ€™ to make viewers practice new swear words) and having such a good cast, we might be dealing with the closest thing to MBCâ€™s glorious mid-to-late 90s Weekend Dramas like ì•„íŒŒíŠ¸ (Apartment) or (Roses &amp; Beansprouts) in a while.
