13,The Spring Day of My Life,"South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (ROK), is a country in East Asia, constituting the southern part of the Korean Peninsula and lying to the east of the Asian mainland. The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time, ruling most of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia, under Gwanggaeto the Great. South Korea lies in the north temperate zone and has a predominantly mountainous terrain. It comprises an estimated 51.4 million residents distributed over 100,363 km2 (38,750 sq mi). Its capital and largest city is Seoul, with a population of around 10 million.
Archaeology indicates that the Korean Peninsula was inhabited by early humans starting from the Lower Paleolithic period (2.6 Ma–300 Ka). The history of Korea begins with the foundation of Gojoseon in 2333 BCE by the mythic king Dangun, but no archaeological evidence and writing was found from this period. The Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in 11th century BCE, and its existence and role has been controversial in the modern era. The written historical record on Gojoseon (Old Joseon) was first mentioned in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under Unified Silla in CE 668, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910). It was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. At the end of World War II, Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S. zones of occupations. A separate election was held in the U.S. zone in 1948 which led to the creation of the Republic of Korea (ROK), while the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was established in the Soviet zone. The United Nations at the time passed a resolution declaring the ROK to be the only lawful government in Korea.The Korean War began in June 1950 when forces from North Korea invaded South Korea. The war lasted three years and involved the U.S., China, the Soviet Union and several other nations. The border between the two nations remains the most heavily fortified in the world. Under long-time military leader Park Chung-hee, the South Korean economy grew significantly and the country was transformed into a G-20 major economy. Military rule ended in 1987, and the country is now a presidential republic consisting of 17 administrative divisions.
South Korea is a highly developed country and a high-income economy, with a ""very high"" Human Development Index, ranking 22nd in the world. The country is considered a regional power and is the world's 11th largest economy by nominal GDP and the 12th largest by PPP as of 2010. South Korea is a global leader in the industrial and technological sectors, being the world's 5th largest exporter and 8th largest importer. Its export-driven economy primarily focuses production on electronics, automobiles, ships, machinery, petrochemicals and robotics. South Korea is a member of the ASEAN Plus mechanism, the United Nations, Uniting for Consensus, G20, the WTO and OECD and is a founding member of APEC and the East Asia Summit.","['1948 establishments in South Korea', 'All Wikipedia articles in need of updating', 'All articles containing potentially dated statements', 'All articles with dead external links', 'All articles with self-published sources', 'All articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Articles containing Korean-language text', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2005', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2010', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2016', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2018', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from May 2009', 'Articles with Curlie links', 'Articles with French-language external links', 'Articles with Korean-language external links', 'Articles with dead external links from April 2017', 'Articles with dead external links from February 2009', 'Articles with dead external links from July 2017', 'Articles with hAudio microformats', 'Articles with obsolete information from March 2012', 'Articles with permanently dead external links', 'Articles with self-published sources from December 2017', 'Articles with short description', 'Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from May 2012', 'Articles with unsourced statements from June 2018', 'CS1 Chinese-language sources (zh)', 'CS1 Korean-language sources (ko)', 'CS1 maint: BOT: original-url status unknown', 'CS1 uses Chinese-language script (zh)', 'CS1 uses Korean-language script (ko)', 'Coordinates on Wikidata', 'East Asian countries', 'G20 nations', 'Korea', 'Korean-speaking countries and territories', 'Member states of the United Nations', 'Northeast Asian countries', 'Official website different in Wikidata and Wikipedia', 'Pages using infobox country or infobox former country with the symbol caption or type parameters', 'Republics', 'South Korea', 'States and territories established in 1948', 'Use mdy dates from November 2017', 'Webarchive template wayback links', 'Webarchive template webcite links', 'Wikipedia articles incorporating text from the World Factbook', 'Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with MusicBrainz area identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with WorldCat-VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages']","['Melodrama', 'Romance', 'Comedy', 'Medical', 'Family']",MBC,"This is a melodrama about a woman who received heart transplant and a man who loved his late wife very much.</p><p>Lee Bom Yi (<a href=""http://star.koreandrama.org/?p=6572"" target=""_blank"">Choi Soo Young</a>) decided to live her life to the fullest as a token of gratitude for the donor.

50,Family Secrets,"South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (ROK), is a country in East Asia, constituting the southern part of the Korean Peninsula and lying to the east of the Asian mainland. The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time, ruling most of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia, under Gwanggaeto the Great. South Korea lies in the north temperate zone and has a predominantly mountainous terrain. It comprises an estimated 51.4 million residents distributed over 100,363 km2 (38,750 sq mi). Its capital and largest city is Seoul, with a population of around 10 million.
Archaeology indicates that the Korean Peninsula was inhabited by early humans starting from the Lower Paleolithic period (2.6 Ma–300 Ka). The history of Korea begins with the foundation of Gojoseon in 2333 BCE by the mythic king Dangun, but no archaeological evidence and writing was found from this period. The Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in 11th century BCE, and its existence and role has been controversial in the modern era. The written historical record on Gojoseon (Old Joseon) was first mentioned in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under Unified Silla in CE 668, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910). It was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. At the end of World War II, Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S. zones of occupations. A separate election was held in the U.S. zone in 1948 which led to the creation of the Republic of Korea (ROK), while the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was established in the Soviet zone. The United Nations at the time passed a resolution declaring the ROK to be the only lawful government in Korea.The Korean War began in June 1950 when forces from North Korea invaded South Korea. The war lasted three years and involved the U.S., China, the Soviet Union and several other nations. The border between the two nations remains the most heavily fortified in the world. Under long-time military leader Park Chung-hee, the South Korean economy grew significantly and the country was transformed into a G-20 major economy. Military rule ended in 1987, and the country is now a presidential republic consisting of 17 administrative divisions.
South Korea is a highly developed country and a high-income economy, with a ""very high"" Human Development Index, ranking 22nd in the world. The country is considered a regional power and is the world's 11th largest economy by nominal GDP and the 12th largest by PPP as of 2010. South Korea is a global leader in the industrial and technological sectors, being the world's 5th largest exporter and 8th largest importer. Its export-driven economy primarily focuses production on electronics, automobiles, ships, machinery, petrochemicals and robotics.

53,King of High School Life Conduct,"Education in South Korea is provided by both public schools and private schools. Both types of schools receive funding from the government, although the amount that the private schools receive is less than the amount of the state schools. In recent years, Incheon Global Campus  (with start-up support) has kick-started, and Yonsei University opened an international college  to embrace the full English teaching environment scheme.
South Korea is one of the top-performing OECD countries in reading literacy, mathematics and sciences with the average student scoring 542. The country has one of the worlds highest-educated labour forces among OECD countries. The country is well known for its obsession with education, which has come to be called ""education fever"". The resource-poor nation is consistently ranked amongst the top for global education. In the 2014 national rankings of students’ math and science scores by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), South Korea ranked second place worldwide, after Singapore.Higher education is an overwhelmingly serious issue in South Korea society, where it is viewed as one of the fundamental cornerstones of South Korean life. Education is regarded with a high priority for South Korean families, as success in education is necessary for improving one's socioeconomic position in South Korean society. Academic success is often a source of pride for families and within South Korean society at large. South Koreans view education as the main propeller of social mobility for themselves and their family as a gateway to the South Korean middle class. Graduating from a top university is the ultimate marker of prestige, high socioeconomic status, promising marriage prospects, and a respectable career path. An average South Korean child's life revolves around education as pressure to succeed academically is deeply ingrained in South Korean children from an early age. Those who lack a formal university education often face social prejudice.In 2015, the country spent 4.7% of its GDP on all levels of education – roughly equal to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) average. A strong investment in education, a militant drive for success, as well as the passion for excellence has helped the resource poor country rapidly grow its economy over the past 60 years from a war-torn wasteland. South Korea’s zeal for education and its students’ desires to get into a prestigious university is one of the highest in the world, as the entrance into a top tier higher educational institution leads to a prestigious, secure and well-paid white collar job with the government, banks, a major South Korean conglomerate such as Samsung, Hyundai or LG Electronics. With incredible pressure on high school students to secure places at the nation’s best universities, its institutional reputation and alumni networks are strong predictors of future career prospects. The top three universities in South Korea, often referred to as ""SKY"", are Seoul National University, Korea University and Yonsei University. Intense competition and pressure to earn the highest grades is deeply ingrained in the psyche of South Korean students at a young age. Yet with only so many places at universities and even fewer places at top-tier companies, many young people remain disappointed and are often unwilling to lower their sights with the result of many feeling as underachievers. 
There is a major cultural taboo in South Korean society attached to those who have not achieved formal university education, where those who don't hold university degrees face social prejudice and are often looked down by others as second-class citizens, resulting fewer opportunities for employment, improvement of one's socioeconomic position and prospects for marriage.International reception on the South Korean education system has been divided. It has been praised for various reasons, including its comparatively high test results and its major role in ushering South Korea's economic development creating one of the world’s most educated workforces.
South Korea's highly enviable academic performance has gotten British education ministers actively remodeling their own curriculum's and exams to try to emulate Korea's militant drive and passion for excellence and high educational achievement. U.S. President Barack Obama has also praised the country's rigorous school system, where over 80 percent of South Korean high school graduates go on to university. The nation's high university entrance rate has created a highly skilled workforce making South Korea among the most highly educated countries in the world with the one of the highest percentage of its citizens holding a tertiary education degree. Bachelor's degrees are held by 68 percent of South Koreans aged 25–34, the most in the OECD.The system's rigid and hierarchical structure has been criticized for stifling creativity and innovation; described as intensely and ""brutally"" competitive, The system is often blamed for the high suicide rate in South Korea, particularly the growing rates among those aged 10–19. Various media outlets attribute the nations high suicide rate on the nationwide anxiety around the country's college entrance exams, which determine the trajectory of students' entire lives and careers.  Former South Korean hagwon teacher Se-Woong Koo wrote that the South Korean education system amounts to child abuse and that it should be ""reformed and restructured without delay."" The system has also been criticized for producing an excess supply of university graduates creating an overeducated and underemployed labor force; in the first quarter of 2013 alone, nearly 3.3 million South Korean university graduates were jobless, leading many graduates overqualified for jobs requiring less education. Further criticism has been stemmed for causing labor shortages in various skilled blue collar labor and vocational occupations, where many go unfilled as the negative social stigma associated with vocational careers and not having a university degree continues to remain deep-rooted in South Korean society.","['All articles needing additional references', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Articles containing Korean-language text', 'Articles needing additional references from July 2010', 'Articles with unsourced statements from April 2008', 'Articles with unsourced statements from August 2014', 'Articles with unsourced statements from February 2008', 'Articles with unsourced statements from January 2009', 'Articles with unsourced statements from June 2008', 'CS1 Korean-language sources (ko)', 'CS1 Spanish-language sources (es)', 'CS1 uses Korean-language script (ko)', 'Education in South Korea', 'Pages using deprecated image syntax', 'Pages with URL errors', 'Wikipedia articles needing clarification from September 2012']","['Romance', 'Comedy']",tvN,"A romantic comedy between a high school student who enters a major company who then becomes part of a management team and a woman who is a temporary employee at that same company.</p><p>Lee Min Suk (<a href=""http://star.koreandrama.org/?p=19512"" target=""_blank"">Seo In Guk</a>) is a high school student who plays ice hockey for his school.

The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time, ruling most of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia, under Gwanggaeto the Great. South Korea lies in the north temperate zone and has a predominantly mountainous terrain. It comprises an estimated 51.4 million residents distributed over 100,363 km2 (38,750 sq mi). Its capital and largest city is Seoul, with a population of around 10 million.
Archaeology indicates that the Korean Peninsula was inhabited by early humans starting from the Lower Paleolithic period (2.6 Ma–300 Ka). The history of Korea begins with the foundation of Gojoseon in 2333 BCE by the mythic king Dangun, but no archaeological evidence and writing was found from this period. The Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in 11th century BCE, and its existence and role has been controversial in the modern era. The written historical record on Gojoseon (Old Joseon) was first mentioned in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under Unified Silla in CE 668, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910). It was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. At the end of World War II, Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S. zones of occupations. A separate election was held in the U.S. zone in 1948 which led to the creation of the Republic of Korea (ROK), while the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was established in the Soviet zone. The United Nations at the time passed a resolution declaring the ROK to be the only lawful government in Korea.The Korean War began in June 1950 when forces from North Korea invaded South Korea. The war lasted three years and involved the U.S., China, the Soviet Union and several other nations. The border between the two nations remains the most heavily fortified in the world. Under long-time military leader Park Chung-hee, the South Korean economy grew significantly and the country was transformed into a G-20 major economy. Military rule ended in 1987, and the country is now a presidential republic consisting of 17 administrative divisions.
South Korea is a highly developed country and a high-income economy, with a ""very high"" Human Development Index, ranking 22nd in the world. The country is considered a regional power and is the world's 11th largest economy by nominal GDP and the 12th largest by PPP as of 2010. South Korea is a global leader in the industrial and technological sectors, being the world's 5th largest exporter and 8th largest importer. Its export-driven economy primarily focuses production on electronics, automobiles, ships, machinery, petrochemicals and robotics. South Korea is a member of the ASEAN Plus mechanism, the United Nations, Uniting for Consensus, G20, the WTO and OECD and is a founding member of APEC and the East Asia Summit.","['1948 establishments in South Korea', 'All Wikipedia articles in need of updating', 'All articles containing potentially dated statements', 'All articles with dead external links', 'All articles with self-published sources', 'All articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Articles containing Korean-language text', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2005', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2010', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2016', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2018', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from May 2009', 'Articles with Curlie links', 'Articles with French-language external links', 'Articles with Korean-language external links', 'Articles with dead external links from April 2017', 'Articles with dead external links from February 2009', 'Articles with dead external links from July 2017', 'Articles with hAudio microformats', 'Articles with obsolete information from March 2012', 'Articles with permanently dead external links', 'Articles with self-published sources from December 2017', 'Articles with short description', 'Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from May 2012', 'Articles with unsourced statements from June 2018', 'CS1 Chinese-language sources (zh)', 'CS1 Korean-language sources (ko)', 'CS1 maint: BOT: original-url status unknown', 'CS1 uses Chinese-language script (zh)', 'CS1 uses Korean-language script (ko)', 'Coordinates on Wikidata', 'East Asian countries', 'G20 nations', 'Korea', 'Korean-speaking countries and territories', 'Member states of the United Nations', 'Northeast Asian countries', 'Official website different in Wikidata and Wikipedia', 'Pages using infobox country or infobox former country with the symbol caption or type parameters', 'Republics', 'South Korea', 'States and territories established in 1948', 'Use mdy dates from November 2017', 'Webarchive template wayback links', 'Webarchive template webcite links', 'Wikipedia articles incorporating text from the World Factbook', 'Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with MusicBrainz area identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with WorldCat-VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages']","['Mystery', 'Thriller']",OCN,"Kang Woo Hyun (<a href=""https://star.koreandrama.org/lee-seo-jin/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Lee Seo Jin</a>) is a respected anchor at a broadcasting station.

60,Bad Couple,"Education in South Korea is provided by both public schools and private schools. Both types of schools receive funding from the government, although the amount that the private schools receive is less than the amount of the state schools. In recent years, Incheon Global Campus  (with start-up support) has kick-started, and Yonsei University opened an international college  to embrace the full English teaching environment scheme.
South Korea is one of the top-performing OECD countries in reading literacy, mathematics and sciences with the average student scoring 542. The country has one of the worlds highest-educated labour forces among OECD countries. The country is well known for its obsession with education, which has come to be called ""education fever"". The resource-poor nation is consistently ranked amongst the top for global education. In the 2014 national rankings of students’ math and science scores by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), South Korea ranked second place worldwide, after Singapore.Higher education is an overwhelmingly serious issue in South Korea society, where it is viewed as one of the fundamental cornerstones of South Korean life. Education is regarded with a high priority for South Korean families, as success in education is necessary for improving one's socioeconomic position in South Korean society. Academic success is often a source of pride for families and within South Korean society at large. South Koreans view education as the main propeller of social mobility for themselves and their family as a gateway to the South Korean middle class. Graduating from a top university is the ultimate marker of prestige, high socioeconomic status, promising marriage prospects, and a respectable career path. An average South Korean child's life revolves around education as pressure to succeed academically is deeply ingrained in South Korean children from an early age. Those who lack a formal university education often face social prejudice.In 2015, the country spent 4.7% of its GDP on all levels of education – roughly equal to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) average. A strong investment in education, a militant drive for success, as well as the passion for excellence has helped the resource poor country rapidly grow its economy over the past 60 years from a war-torn wasteland. South Korea’s zeal for education and its students’ desires to get into a prestigious university is one of the highest in the world, as the entrance into a top tier higher educational institution leads to a prestigious, secure and well-paid white collar job with the government, banks, a major South Korean conglomerate such as Samsung, Hyundai or LG Electronics. With incredible pressure on high school students to secure places at the nation’s best universities, its institutional reputation and alumni networks are strong predictors of future career prospects. The top three universities in South Korea, often referred to as ""SKY"", are Seoul National University, Korea University and Yonsei University. Intense competition and pressure to earn the highest grades is deeply ingrained in the psyche of South Korean students at a young age. Yet with only so many places at universities and even fewer places at top-tier companies, many young people remain disappointed and are often unwilling to lower their sights with the result of many feeling as underachievers. 
There is a major cultural taboo in South Korean society attached to those who have not achieved formal university education, where those who don't hold university degrees face social prejudice and are often looked down by others as second-class citizens, resulting fewer opportunities for employment, improvement of one's socioeconomic position and prospects for marriage.International reception on the South Korean education system has been divided. It has been praised for various reasons, including its comparatively high test results and its major role in ushering South Korea's economic development creating one of the world’s most educated workforces.
South Korea's highly enviable academic performance has gotten British education ministers actively remodeling their own curriculum's and exams to try to emulate Korea's militant drive and passion for excellence and high educational achievement. U.S. President Barack Obama has also praised the country's rigorous school system, where over 80 percent of South Korean high school graduates go on to university. The nation's high university entrance rate has created a highly skilled workforce making South Korea among the most highly educated countries in the world with the one of the highest percentage of its citizens holding a tertiary education degree. Bachelor's degrees are held by 68 percent of South Koreans aged 25–34, the most in the OECD.The system's rigid and hierarchical structure has been criticized for stifling creativity and innovation; described as intensely and ""brutally"" competitive, The system is often blamed for the high suicide rate in South Korea, particularly the growing rates among those aged 10–19. Various media outlets attribute the nations high suicide rate on the nationwide anxiety around the country's college entrance exams, which determine the trajectory of students' entire lives and careers.  Former South Korean hagwon teacher Se-Woong Koo wrote that the South Korean education system amounts to child abuse and that it should be ""reformed and restructured without delay."" The system has also been criticized for producing an excess supply of university graduates creating an overeducated and underemployed labor force; in the first quarter of 2013 alone, nearly 3.3 million South Korean university graduates were jobless, leading many graduates overqualified for jobs requiring less education. Further criticism has been stemmed for causing labor shortages in various skilled blue collar labor and vocational occupations, where many go unfilled as the negative social stigma associated with vocational careers and not having a university degree continues to remain deep-rooted in South Korean society.","['All articles needing additional references', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Articles containing Korean-language text', 'Articles needing additional references from July 2010', 'Articles with unsourced statements from April 2008', 'Articles with unsourced statements from August 2014', 'Articles with unsourced statements from February 2008', 'Articles with unsourced statements from January 2009', 'Articles with unsourced statements from June 2008', 'CS1 Korean-language sources (ko)', 'CS1 Spanish-language sources (es)', 'CS1 uses Korean-language script (ko)', 'Education in South Korea', 'Pages using deprecated image syntax', 'Pages with URL errors', 'Wikipedia articles needing clarification from September 2012']","['Romance', 'comedy']",SBS,"Choi Jae Chun is an university professor with “perfect genes.” The drama is about an editor of a fashion magazine, Kim Kang Ja, who suddenly develops an urge to have her own baby despite opposing the idea of marriage.

79,The Lawyers of The Great Republic Korea,"The politics of North Korea (officially the Democratic People's Republic of Korea) takes place within the framework of the official state philosophy, Juche, a concept created by Hwang Jang-yop and later attributed to Kim Il-sung. The Juche theory is the belief that through self-reliance and a strong independent state, true socialism can be achieved.North Korea's political system is built upon the principle of centralization. While the North Korean constitution formally guarantees protection of human rights, in practice there are severe limits on freedom of expression, and the government closely supervises the lives of North Korean citizens. The constitution defines North Korea as ""a dictatorship of people's democracy"" under the leadership of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK), which is given legal supremacy over other political parties.
The WPK is the ruling party of North Korea. It has been in power since its creation in 1948. Two minor political parties also exist, but are legally bound to accept the ruling role of the WPK. They, with the WPK, comprise the popular front Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland (DFRF). Elections occur only in single-candidate races where the candidate is effectively selected beforehand by the WPK.In addition to the parties, there are over 100 mass organizations controlled by the WPK. Those who are not WPK members are required to join one of these organizations. Of these, the most important ones are the Kimilsungist-Kimjongilist Youth League, Socialist Women's Union of Korea, General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea, and Union of Agricultural Workers of Korea. These four organizations are also DFRF members.Kim Il-sung ruled the country from 1948 until his death in July 1994, holding the offices of General Secretary of the WPK from 1949 to 1994 (titled as Chairman from 1949 to 1972), Premier of North Korea from 1948 to 1972 and President from 1972 to 1994. He was succeeded by his son, Kim Jong-il.  While the younger Kim had been his father's designated successor since the 1980s, it took him three years to consolidate his power. He was named to his father's old post of General Secretary in 1997, and in 1998 became chairman of the National Defence Commission (NDC), which gave him command of the armed forces. The constitution was amended to make the NDC chairmanship ""the highest post in the state."" At the same time, the presidential post was written out of the constitution, and Kim Il-sung was designated ""Eternal President of the Republic"" in order to honor his memory forever. Most analysts believe the title to be a product of the cult of personality he cultivated during his life.
Outside observers generally views North Korea as a totalitarian dictatorship particularly noting the elaborate cult of personality around Kim Il-sung and his family. The Workers' Party of Korea (WPK), led by a member of the ruling family, holds power in the state and leads the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland of which all political officers are required to be members.;The government has formally replaced all references to Marxism–Leninism in its constitution with the locally developed concept of Juche, or self-reliance. In recent years, there has been great emphasis on the Songun or ""military-first"" philosophy. All references to communism were removed from the North Korean constitution in 2009.The status of the military has been enhanced, and it appears to occupy the center of the North Korean political system; all the social sectors are forced to follow the military spirit and adopt military methods. Kim Jong-il's public activity focused heavily on ""on-the-spot guidance"" of places and events related to the military. The enhanced status of the military and military-centered political system was confirmed at the first session of the 10th Supreme People's Assembly (SPA) by the promotion of NDC members into the official power hierarchy. All ten NDC members were ranked within the top twenty on 5 September, and all but one occupied the top twenty at the fiftieth anniversary of the Day of the Foundation of the Republic on 9 September.","['All articles lacking reliable references', 'All articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Articles containing Korean-language text', 'Articles lacking reliable references from December 2016', 'Articles with Curlie links', 'Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from October 2015', 'Articles with unsourced quotes', 'Articles with unsourced statements from October 2015', 'Politics of North Korea', 'Use dmy dates from January 2018', 'Webarchive template other archives', 'Webarchive template webcite links']",['Romance'],MBC,"“LOVE &amp; LAW” is a tale about a man involved in a divorce lawsuit, and his lawyer’s attempt to salvage his money and love.

134,Han River Ballad,"South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (ROK), is a country in East Asia, constituting the southern part of the Korean Peninsula and lying to the east of the Asian mainland. The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time, ruling most of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia, under Gwanggaeto the Great. South Korea lies in the north temperate zone and has a predominantly mountainous terrain. It comprises an estimated 51.4 million residents distributed over 100,363 km2 (38,750 sq mi). Its capital and largest city is Seoul, with a population of around 10 million.
Archaeology indicates that the Korean Peninsula was inhabited by early humans starting from the Lower Paleolithic period (2.6 Ma–300 Ka). The history of Korea begins with the foundation of Gojoseon in 2333 BCE by the mythic king Dangun, but no archaeological evidence and writing was found from this period. The Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in 11th century BCE, and its existence and role has been controversial in the modern era. The written historical record on Gojoseon (Old Joseon) was first mentioned in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under Unified Silla in CE 668, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910). It was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. At the end of World War II, Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S. zones of occupations. A separate election was held in the U.S. zone in 1948 which led to the creation of the Republic of Korea (ROK), while the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was established in the Soviet zone. The United Nations at the time passed a resolution declaring the ROK to be the only lawful government in Korea.The Korean War began in June 1950 when forces from North Korea invaded South Korea. The war lasted three years and involved the U.S., China, the Soviet Union and several other nations. The border between the two nations remains the most heavily fortified in the world. Under long-time military leader Park Chung-hee, the South Korean economy grew significantly and the country was transformed into a G-20 major economy. Military rule ended in 1987, and the country is now a presidential republic consisting of 17 administrative divisions.
South Korea is a highly developed country and a high-income economy, with a ""very high"" Human Development Index, ranking 22nd in the world. The country is considered a regional power and is the world's 11th largest economy by nominal GDP and the 12th largest by PPP as of 2010. South Korea is a global leader in the industrial and technological sectors, being the world's 5th largest exporter and 8th largest importer. Its export-driven economy primarily focuses production on electronics, automobiles, ships, machinery, petrochemicals and robotics. South Korea is a member of the ASEAN Plus mechanism, the United Nations, Uniting for Consensus, G20, the WTO and OECD and is a founding member of APEC and the East Asia Summit.","['1948 establishments in South Korea', 'All Wikipedia articles in need of updating', 'All articles containing potentially dated statements', 'All articles with dead external links', 'All articles with self-published sources', 'All articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Articles containing Korean-language text', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2005', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2010', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2016', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2018', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from May 2009', 'Articles with Curlie links', 'Articles with French-language external links', 'Articles with Korean-language external links', 'Articles with dead external links from April 2017', 'Articles with dead external links from February 2009', 'Articles with dead external links from July 2017', 'Articles with hAudio microformats', 'Articles with obsolete information from March 2012', 'Articles with permanently dead external links', 'Articles with self-published sources from December 2017', 'Articles with short description', 'Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from May 2012', 'Articles with unsourced statements from June 2018', 'CS1 Chinese-language sources (zh)', 'CS1 Korean-language sources (ko)', 'CS1 maint: BOT: original-url status unknown', 'CS1 uses Chinese-language script (zh)', 'CS1 uses Korean-language script (ko)', 'Coordinates on Wikidata', 'East Asian countries', 'G20 nations', 'Korea', 'Korean-speaking countries and territories', 'Member states of the United Nations', 'Northeast Asian countries', 'Official website different in Wikidata and Wikipedia', 'Pages using infobox country or infobox former country with the symbol caption or type parameters', 'Republics', 'South Korea', 'States and territories established in 1948', 'Use mdy dates from November 2017', 'Webarchive template wayback links', 'Webarchive template webcite links', 'Wikipedia articles incorporating text from the World Factbook', 'Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with MusicBrainz area identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with WorldCat-VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages']","['Romance', 'familylife']",MBC,"MBC TV’s weekend drama, “Song of the Han River” is a story of life and love involving a vibrant middle-aged woman, her two daughters, a niece, a nephew, and a cast of other characters surrounding them.

166,Shoot for the star,"South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (ROK), is a country in East Asia, constituting the southern part of the Korean Peninsula and lying to the east of the Asian mainland. The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time, ruling most of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia, under Gwanggaeto the Great. South Korea lies in the north temperate zone and has a predominantly mountainous terrain. It comprises an estimated 51.4 million residents distributed over 100,363 km2 (38,750 sq mi). Its capital and largest city is Seoul, with a population of around 10 million.
Archaeology indicates that the Korean Peninsula was inhabited by early humans starting from the Lower Paleolithic period (2.6 Ma–300 Ka). The history of Korea begins with the foundation of Gojoseon in 2333 BCE by the mythic king Dangun, but no archaeological evidence and writing was found from this period. The Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in 11th century BCE, and its existence and role has been controversial in the modern era. The written historical record on Gojoseon (Old Joseon) was first mentioned in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under Unified Silla in CE 668, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910). It was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. At the end of World War II, Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S. zones of occupations. A separate election was held in the U.S. zone in 1948 which led to the creation of the Republic of Korea (ROK), while the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was established in the Soviet zone. The United Nations at the time passed a resolution declaring the ROK to be the only lawful government in Korea.The Korean War began in June 1950 when forces from North Korea invaded South Korea. The war lasted three years and involved the U.S., China, the Soviet Union and several other nations. The border between the two nations remains the most heavily fortified in the world. Under long-time military leader Park Chung-hee, the South Korean economy grew significantly and the country was transformed into a G-20 major economy. Military rule ended in 1987, and the country is now a presidential republic consisting of 17 administrative divisions.
South Korea is a highly developed country and a high-income economy, with a ""very high"" Human Development Index, ranking 22nd in the world. The country is considered a regional power and is the world's 11th largest economy by nominal GDP and the 12th largest by PPP as of 2010. South Korea is a global leader in the industrial and technological sectors, being the world's 5th largest exporter and 8th largest importer. Its export-driven economy primarily focuses production on electronics, automobiles, ships, machinery, petrochemicals and robotics.

189,Geu-rin Ro-jeu / Green Rose,NaN,NaN,"['Drama', 'Romance', 'Suspense']",SBS,"Lee Jung-Hyun (Go Su) is accused for murdering Oh Soo-Ah’s (Lee Da Hae) father. He runs away and becomes a fugitive. Later, he returns and seeks out revenge. Oh Soo-Ah who is the successor of the enterprise “First Electronic” falls in love with Lee Jung-Hyun."
190,Real School!,"Education in South Korea is provided by both public schools and private schools. Both types of schools receive funding from the government, although the amount that the private schools receive is less than the amount of the state schools. In recent years, Incheon Global Campus  (with start-up support) has kick-started, and Yonsei University opened an international college  to embrace the full English teaching environment scheme.
South Korea is one of the top-performing OECD countries in reading literacy, mathematics and sciences with the average student scoring 542. The country has one of the worlds highest-educated labour forces among OECD countries. The country is well known for its obsession with education, which has come to be called ""education fever"". The resource-poor nation is consistently ranked amongst the top for global education. In the 2014 national rankings of students’ math and science scores by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), South Korea ranked second place worldwide, after Singapore.Higher education is an overwhelmingly serious issue in South Korea society, where it is viewed as one of the fundamental cornerstones of South Korean life. Education is regarded with a high priority for South Korean families, as success in education is necessary for improving one's socioeconomic position in South Korean society. Academic success is often a source of pride for families and within South Korean society at large. South Koreans view education as the main propeller of social mobility for themselves and their family as a gateway to the South Korean middle class. Graduating from a top university is the ultimate marker of prestige, high socioeconomic status, promising marriage prospects, and a respectable career path. An average South Korean child's life revolves around education as pressure to succeed academically is deeply ingrained in South Korean children from an early age. Those who lack a formal university education often face social prejudice.In 2015, the country spent 4.7% of its GDP on all levels of education – roughly equal to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) average. A strong investment in education, a militant drive for success, as well as the passion for excellence has helped the resource poor country rapidly grow its economy over the past 60 years from a war-torn wasteland. South Korea’s zeal for education and its students’ desires to get into a prestigious university is one of the highest in the world, as the entrance into a top tier higher educational institution leads to a prestigious, secure and well-paid white collar job with the government, banks, a major South Korean conglomerate such as Samsung, Hyundai or LG Electronics. With incredible pressure on high school students to secure places at the nation’s best universities, its institutional reputation and alumni networks are strong predictors of future career prospects. The top three universities in South Korea, often referred to as ""SKY"", are Seoul National University, Korea University and Yonsei University. Intense competition and pressure to earn the highest grades is deeply ingrained in the psyche of South Korean students at a young age. Yet with only so many places at universities and even fewer places at top-tier companies, many young people remain disappointed and are often unwilling to lower their sights with the result of many feeling as underachievers. 
There is a major cultural taboo in South Korean society attached to those who have not achieved formal university education, where those who don't hold university degrees face social prejudice and are often looked down by others as second-class citizens, resulting fewer opportunities for employment, improvement of one's socioeconomic position and prospects for marriage.International reception on the South Korean education system has been divided. It has been praised for various reasons, including its comparatively high test results and its major role in ushering South Korea's economic development creating one of the world’s most educated workforces.
South Korea's highly enviable academic performance has gotten British education ministers actively remodeling their own curriculum's and exams to try to emulate Korea's militant drive and passion for excellence and high educational achievement. U.S. President Barack Obama has also praised the country's rigorous school system, where over 80 percent of South Korean high school graduates go on to university. The nation's high university entrance rate has created a highly skilled workforce making South Korea among the most highly educated countries in the world with the one of the highest percentage of its citizens holding a tertiary education degree. Bachelor's degrees are held by 68 percent of South Koreans aged 25–34, the most in the OECD.The system's rigid and hierarchical structure has been criticized for stifling creativity and innovation; described as intensely and ""brutally"" competitive, The system is often blamed for the high suicide rate in South Korea, particularly the growing rates among those aged 10–19. Various media outlets attribute the nations high suicide rate on the nationwide anxiety around the country's college entrance exams, which determine the trajectory of students' entire lives and careers.  Former South Korean hagwon teacher Se-Woong Koo wrote that the South Korean education system amounts to child abuse and that it should be ""reformed and restructured without delay."" The system has also been criticized for producing an excess supply of university graduates creating an overeducated and underemployed labor force; in the first quarter of 2013 alone, nearly 3.3 million South Korean university graduates were jobless, leading many graduates overqualified for jobs requiring less education. Further criticism has been stemmed for causing labor shortages in various skilled blue collar labor and vocational occupations, where many go unfilled as the negative social stigma associated with vocational careers and not having a university degree continues to remain deep-rooted in South Korean society.","['All articles needing additional references', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Articles containing Korean-language text', 'Articles needing additional references from July 2010', 'Articles with unsourced statements from April 2008', 'Articles with unsourced statements from August 2014', 'Articles with unsourced statements from February 2008', 'Articles with unsourced statements from January 2009', 'Articles with unsourced statements from June 2008', 'CS1 Korean-language sources (ko)', 'CS1 Spanish-language sources (es)', 'CS1 uses Korean-language script (ko)', 'Education in South Korea', 'Pages using deprecated image syntax', 'Pages with URL errors', 'Wikipedia articles needing clarification from September 2012']",['Sitcom'],MBC every1,A sitcom about a group of students who have a phobia of English.

194,Famous Princesses,"South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (ROK), is a country in East Asia, constituting the southern part of the Korean Peninsula and lying to the east of the Asian mainland. The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time, ruling most of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia, under Gwanggaeto the Great. South Korea lies in the north temperate zone and has a predominantly mountainous terrain. It comprises an estimated 51.4 million residents distributed over 100,363 km2 (38,750 sq mi). Its capital and largest city is Seoul, with a population of around 10 million.
Archaeology indicates that the Korean Peninsula was inhabited by early humans starting from the Lower Paleolithic period (2.6 Ma–300 Ka). The history of Korea begins with the foundation of Gojoseon in 2333 BCE by the mythic king Dangun, but no archaeological evidence and writing was found from this period. The Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in 11th century BCE, and its existence and role has been controversial in the modern era. The written historical record on Gojoseon (Old Joseon) was first mentioned in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under Unified Silla in CE 668, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910). It was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. At the end of World War II, Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S. zones of occupations. A separate election was held in the U.S. zone in 1948 which led to the creation of the Republic of Korea (ROK), while the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was established in the Soviet zone. The United Nations at the time passed a resolution declaring the ROK to be the only lawful government in Korea.The Korean War began in June 1950 when forces from North Korea invaded South Korea. The war lasted three years and involved the U.S., China, the Soviet Union and several other nations. The border between the two nations remains the most heavily fortified in the world. Under long-time military leader Park Chung-hee, the South Korean economy grew significantly and the country was transformed into a G-20 major economy. Military rule ended in 1987, and the country is now a presidential republic consisting of 17 administrative divisions.
South Korea is a highly developed country and a high-income economy, with a ""very high"" Human Development Index, ranking 22nd in the world. The country is considered a regional power and is the world's 11th largest economy by nominal GDP and the 12th largest by PPP as of 2010. South Korea is a global leader in the industrial and technological sectors, being the world's 5th largest exporter and 8th largest importer. Its export-driven economy primarily focuses production on electronics, automobiles, ships, machinery, petrochemicals and robotics.

230,Love Pub,"South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (ROK), is a country in East Asia, constituting the southern part of the Korean Peninsula and lying to the east of the Asian mainland. The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time, ruling most of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia, under Gwanggaeto the Great. South Korea lies in the north temperate zone and has a predominantly mountainous terrain. It comprises an estimated 51.4 million residents distributed over 100,363 km2 (38,750 sq mi). Its capital and largest city is Seoul, with a population of around 10 million.
Archaeology indicates that the Korean Peninsula was inhabited by early humans starting from the Lower Paleolithic period (2.6 Ma–300 Ka). The history of Korea begins with the foundation of Gojoseon in 2333 BCE by the mythic king Dangun, but no archaeological evidence and writing was found from this period. The Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in 11th century BCE, and its existence and role has been controversial in the modern era. The written historical record on Gojoseon (Old Joseon) was first mentioned in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under Unified Silla in CE 668, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910). It was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. At the end of World War II, Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S. zones of occupations. A separate election was held in the U.S. zone in 1948 which led to the creation of the Republic of Korea (ROK), while the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was established in the Soviet zone. The United Nations at the time passed a resolution declaring the ROK to be the only lawful government in Korea.The Korean War began in June 1950 when forces from North Korea invaded South Korea. The war lasted three years and involved the U.S., China, the Soviet Union and several other nations. The border between the two nations remains the most heavily fortified in the world. Under long-time military leader Park Chung-hee, the South Korean economy grew significantly and the country was transformed into a G-20 major economy. Military rule ended in 1987, and the country is now a presidential republic consisting of 17 administrative divisions.
South Korea is a highly developed country and a high-income economy, with a ""very high"" Human Development Index, ranking 22nd in the world. The country is considered a regional power and is the world's 11th largest economy by nominal GDP and the 12th largest by PPP as of 2010. South Korea is a global leader in the industrial and technological sectors, being the world's 5th largest exporter and 8th largest importer. Its export-driven economy primarily focuses production on electronics, automobiles, ships, machinery, petrochemicals and robotics. South Korea is a member of the ASEAN Plus mechanism, the United Nations, Uniting for Consensus, G20, the WTO and OECD and is a founding member of APEC and the East Asia Summit.","['1948 establishments in South Korea', 'All Wikipedia articles in need of updating', 'All articles containing potentially dated statements', 'All articles with dead external links', 'All articles with self-published sources', 'All articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Articles containing Korean-language text', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2005', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2010', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2016', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2018', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from May 2009', 'Articles with Curlie links', 'Articles with French-language external links', 'Articles with Korean-language external links', 'Articles with dead external links from April 2017', 'Articles with dead external links from February 2009', 'Articles with dead external links from July 2017', 'Articles with hAudio microformats', 'Articles with obsolete information from March 2012', 'Articles with permanently dead external links', 'Articles with self-published sources from December 2017', 'Articles with short description', 'Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from May 2012', 'Articles with unsourced statements from June 2018', 'CS1 Chinese-language sources (zh)', 'CS1 Korean-language sources (ko)', 'CS1 maint: BOT: original-url status unknown', 'CS1 uses Chinese-language script (zh)', 'CS1 uses Korean-language script (ko)', 'Coordinates on Wikidata', 'East Asian countries', 'G20 nations', 'Korea', 'Korean-speaking countries and territories', 'Member states of the United Nations', 'Northeast Asian countries', 'Official website different in Wikidata and Wikipedia', 'Pages using infobox country or infobox former country with the symbol caption or type parameters', 'Republics', 'South Korea', 'States and territories established in 1948', 'Use mdy dates from November 2017', 'Webarchive template wayback links', 'Webarchive template webcite links', 'Wikipedia articles incorporating text from the World Factbook', 'Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with MusicBrainz area identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with WorldCat-VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages']","['Youth', 'Romance']",NAVER tvcast,A story about the love and growth of young people who work in a pub.

245,That Person Is Coming,"South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (ROK), is a country in East Asia, constituting the southern part of the Korean Peninsula and lying to the east of the Asian mainland. The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time, ruling most of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia, under Gwanggaeto the Great. South Korea lies in the north temperate zone and has a predominantly mountainous terrain. It comprises an estimated 51.4 million residents distributed over 100,363 km2 (38,750 sq mi). Its capital and largest city is Seoul, with a population of around 10 million.
Archaeology indicates that the Korean Peninsula was inhabited by early humans starting from the Lower Paleolithic period (2.6 Ma–300 Ka). The history of Korea begins with the foundation of Gojoseon in 2333 BCE by the mythic king Dangun, but no archaeological evidence and writing was found from this period. The Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in 11th century BCE, and its existence and role has been controversial in the modern era. The written historical record on Gojoseon (Old Joseon) was first mentioned in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under Unified Silla in CE 668, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910). It was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. At the end of World War II, Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S. zones of occupations. A separate election was held in the U.S. zone in 1948 which led to the creation of the Republic of Korea (ROK), while the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was established in the Soviet zone. The United Nations at the time passed a resolution declaring the ROK to be the only lawful government in Korea.The Korean War began in June 1950 when forces from North Korea invaded South Korea. The war lasted three years and involved the U.S., China, the Soviet Union and several other nations. The border between the two nations remains the most heavily fortified in the world. Under long-time military leader Park Chung-hee, the South Korean economy grew significantly and the country was transformed into a G-20 major economy. Military rule ended in 1987, and the country is now a presidential republic consisting of 17 administrative divisions.
South Korea is a highly developed country and a high-income economy, with a ""very high"" Human Development Index, ranking 22nd in the world. The country is considered a regional power and is the world's 11th largest economy by nominal GDP and the 12th largest by PPP as of 2010. South Korea is a global leader in the industrial and technological sectors, being the world's 5th largest exporter and 8th largest importer.

255,Only Love,"South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (ROK), is a country in East Asia, constituting the southern part of the Korean Peninsula and lying to the east of the Asian mainland. The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time, ruling most of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia, under Gwanggaeto the Great. South Korea lies in the north temperate zone and has a predominantly mountainous terrain. It comprises an estimated 51.4 million residents distributed over 100,363 km2 (38,750 sq mi). Its capital and largest city is Seoul, with a population of around 10 million.
Archaeology indicates that the Korean Peninsula was inhabited by early humans starting from the Lower Paleolithic period (2.6 Ma–300 Ka). The history of Korea begins with the foundation of Gojoseon in 2333 BCE by the mythic king Dangun, but no archaeological evidence and writing was found from this period. The Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in 11th century BCE, and its existence and role has been controversial in the modern era. The written historical record on Gojoseon (Old Joseon) was first mentioned in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under Unified Silla in CE 668, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910). It was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. At the end of World War II, Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S. zones of occupations. A separate election was held in the U.S. zone in 1948 which led to the creation of the Republic of Korea (ROK), while the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was established in the Soviet zone. The United Nations at the time passed a resolution declaring the ROK to be the only lawful government in Korea.The Korean War began in June 1950 when forces from North Korea invaded South Korea. The war lasted three years and involved the U.S., China, the Soviet Union and several other nations. The border between the two nations remains the most heavily fortified in the world. Under long-time military leader Park Chung-hee, the South Korean economy grew significantly and the country was transformed into a G-20 major economy. Military rule ended in 1987, and the country is now a presidential republic consisting of 17 administrative divisions.
South Korea is a highly developed country and a high-income economy, with a ""very high"" Human Development Index, ranking 22nd in the world. The country is considered a regional power and is the world's 11th largest economy by nominal GDP and the 12th largest by PPP as of 2010. South Korea is a global leader in the industrial and technological sectors, being the world's 5th largest exporter and 8th largest importer. Its export-driven economy primarily focuses production on electronics, automobiles, ships, machinery, petrochemicals and robotics.

262,Dae Wang Sejong,"Korea is a region in East Asia. Since 1948, it has been divided between two distinct sovereign states: North Korea and South Korea. Korea consists of the Korean Peninsula, Jeju Island, and several minor islands near the peninsula. Korea is bordered by China to the northwest, Russia to the northeast, and neighbours Japan to the east by the Korea Strait and the Sea of Japan (East Sea).
During the first half of the 1st millennium, Korea was divided between the three competing states of Baekje, Goguryeo, and Silla, together known as the ""Three Kingdoms of Korea"". In the second half of the 1st millennium, Baekje and Goguryeo were conquered by Silla, leading to the ""Unified Silla"" period. Meanwhile, Balhae formed in the north following the collapse of Goguryeo. Unified Silla eventually collapsed into three separate states due to civil war, ushering in the Later Three Kingdoms. Toward the end of the 1st millennium Goryeo, which was a revival of Goguryeo, defeated the two other states and unified the Korean Peninsula as one single state. Around the same time, Balhae collapsed and its last crown prince fled south to Goryeo. Goryeo (also spelled as Koryŏ), whose name developed into the modern exonym ""Korea"", was a highly cultured state that created the world's first metal movable type in 1234. However, multiple invasions by the Mongol Empire during the 13th century greatly weakened the nation, which eventually agreed to become a vassal state after decades of fighting. Following military resistance under King Gongmin which ended Mongol political influence in Goryeo, severe political strife followed, and Goryeo eventually fell to a coup led by General Yi Seong-gye, who established Joseon in 1392.
The first 200 years of Joseon were marked by relative peace. During this period, the Korean alphabet was created by Sejong the Great in the 15th century and there was increasing influence of Confucianism. During the later part of the dynasty, Korea's isolationist policy earned it the Western nickname of the ""Hermit Kingdom"". By the late 19th century, the country became the object of imperial design by the Empire of Japan. After the First Sino-Japanese War, despite the Korean Empire's effort to modernize, it was annexed by Japan in 1910 and ruled by Imperial Japan until the end of World War II in August 1945.
In 1945, the Soviet Union and the United States agreed on the surrender of Japanese forces in Korea in the aftermath of World War II, leaving Korea partitioned along the 38th parallel. The North was under Soviet occupation and the South under U.S. occupation. These circumstances soon became the basis for the division of Korea by the two superpowers, exacerbated by their inability to agree on the terms of Korean independence. The Communist-inspired government in the North received backing from the Soviet Union in opposition to the pro-Western government in the South, leading to Korea's division into two political entities: North Korea (officially the Democratic People's Republic of Korea), and South Korea (officially the Republic of Korea). Tensions between the two resulted in the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950. With involvement by foreign troops, the war ended in a stalemate in 1953, but without a formalized peace treaty. This status contributes to the high tensions that continue to divide the peninsula. Both governments of the two Koreas claim to be the sole legitimate government of the region.","['All articles with self-published sources', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Articles containing Chinese-language text', 'Articles containing Japanese-language text', 'Articles containing Korean-language text', 'Articles containing Vietnamese-language text', 'Articles with Curlie links', 'Articles with self-published sources from December 2017', 'Articles with short description', 'Articles with unsourced statements from April 2013', 'Articles with unsourced statements from April 2017', 'Articles with unsourced statements from October 2014', 'CS1: Julian–Gregorian uncertainty', 'CS1 French-language sources (fr)', 'CS1 Korean-language sources (ko)', 'Coordinates on Wikidata', 'Disputed territories in Asia', 'Divided regions', 'East Asia', 'Korea', 'Korean-speaking countries and territories', 'Northeast Asia', 'Pages using infobox country or infobox former country with the symbol caption or type parameters', 'Use dmy dates from September 2015', 'Webarchive template wayback links', 'Webarchive template webcite links', ""Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from Collier's Encyclopedia"", 'Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the Encyclopedia Americana with a Wikisource reference', 'Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with WorldCat-VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia indefinitely move-protected pages', 'Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages']",['Historical'],,"This drama is about the life of fourth king of the Choson Dynasty of Korea, King Sejong.

264,Best Couple,"South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (ROK), is a country in East Asia, constituting the southern part of the Korean Peninsula and lying to the east of the Asian mainland. The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time, ruling most of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia, under Gwanggaeto the Great. South Korea lies in the north temperate zone and has a predominantly mountainous terrain. It comprises an estimated 51.4 million residents distributed over 100,363 km2 (38,750 sq mi). Its capital and largest city is Seoul, with a population of around 10 million.
Archaeology indicates that the Korean Peninsula was inhabited by early humans starting from the Lower Paleolithic period (2.6 Ma–300 Ka). The history of Korea begins with the foundation of Gojoseon in 2333 BCE by the mythic king Dangun, but no archaeological evidence and writing was found from this period. The Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in 11th century BCE, and its existence and role has been controversial in the modern era. The written historical record on Gojoseon (Old Joseon) was first mentioned in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under Unified Silla in CE 668, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910). It was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. At the end of World War II, Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S. zones of occupations. A separate election was held in the U.S. zone in 1948 which led to the creation of the Republic of Korea (ROK), while the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was established in the Soviet zone. The United Nations at the time passed a resolution declaring the ROK to be the only lawful government in Korea.The Korean War began in June 1950 when forces from North Korea invaded South Korea. The war lasted three years and involved the U.S., China, the Soviet Union and several other nations. The border between the two nations remains the most heavily fortified in the world. Under long-time military leader Park Chung-hee, the South Korean economy grew significantly and the country was transformed into a G-20 major economy. Military rule ended in 1987, and the country is now a presidential republic consisting of 17 administrative divisions.
South Korea is a highly developed country and a high-income economy, with a ""very high"" Human Development Index, ranking 22nd in the world. The country is considered a regional power and is the world's 11th largest economy by nominal GDP and the 12th largest by PPP as of 2010. South Korea is a global leader in the industrial and technological sectors, being the world's 5th largest exporter and 8th largest importer. Its export-driven economy primarily focuses production on electronics, automobiles, ships, machinery, petrochemicals and robotics. South Korea is a member of the ASEAN Plus mechanism, the United Nations, Uniting for Consensus, G20, the WTO and OECD and is a founding member of APEC and the East Asia Summit.","['1948 establishments in South Korea', 'All Wikipedia articles in need of updating', 'All articles containing potentially dated statements', 'All articles with dead external links', 'All articles with self-published sources', 'All articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Articles containing Korean-language text', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2005', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2010', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2016', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2018', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from May 2009', 'Articles with Curlie links', 'Articles with French-language external links', 'Articles with Korean-language external links', 'Articles with dead external links from April 2017', 'Articles with dead external links from February 2009', 'Articles with dead external links from July 2017', 'Articles with hAudio microformats', 'Articles with obsolete information from March 2012', 'Articles with permanently dead external links', 'Articles with self-published sources from December 2017', 'Articles with short description', 'Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from May 2012', 'Articles with unsourced statements from June 2018', 'CS1 Chinese-language sources (zh)', 'CS1 Korean-language sources (ko)', 'CS1 maint: BOT: original-url status unknown', 'CS1 uses Chinese-language script (zh)', 'CS1 uses Korean-language script (ko)', 'Coordinates on Wikidata', 'East Asian countries', 'G20 nations', 'Korea', 'Korean-speaking countries and territories', 'Member states of the United Nations', 'Northeast Asian countries', 'Official website different in Wikidata and Wikipedia', 'Pages using infobox country or infobox former country with the symbol caption or type parameters', 'Republics', 'South Korea', 'States and territories established in 1948', 'Use mdy dates from November 2017', 'Webarchive template wayback links', 'Webarchive template webcite links', 'Wikipedia articles incorporating text from the World Factbook', 'Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with MusicBrainz area identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with WorldCat-VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages']","['Family', 'Romance', 'Comedy']",MBC,"This is a drama about love and relationships, from the point of view of a mother and two daughters.

274,Golden Era of Daughter in Law,"South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (ROK), is a country in East Asia, constituting the southern part of the Korean Peninsula and lying to the east of the Asian mainland. The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time, ruling most of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia, under Gwanggaeto the Great. South Korea lies in the north temperate zone and has a predominantly mountainous terrain. It comprises an estimated 51.4 million residents distributed over 100,363 km2 (38,750 sq mi). Its capital and largest city is Seoul, with a population of around 10 million.
Archaeology indicates that the Korean Peninsula was inhabited by early humans starting from the Lower Paleolithic period (2.6 Ma–300 Ka). The history of Korea begins with the foundation of Gojoseon in 2333 BCE by the mythic king Dangun, but no archaeological evidence and writing was found from this period. The Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in 11th century BCE, and its existence and role has been controversial in the modern era. The written historical record on Gojoseon (Old Joseon) was first mentioned in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under Unified Silla in CE 668, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910). It was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. At the end of World War II, Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S. zones of occupations. A separate election was held in the U.S. zone in 1948 which led to the creation of the Republic of Korea (ROK), while the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was established in the Soviet zone. The United Nations at the time passed a resolution declaring the ROK to be the only lawful government in Korea.The Korean War began in June 1950 when forces from North Korea invaded South Korea. The war lasted three years and involved the U.S., China, the Soviet Union and several other nations. The border between the two nations remains the most heavily fortified in the world. Under long-time military leader Park Chung-hee, the South Korean economy grew significantly and the country was transformed into a G-20 major economy. Military rule ended in 1987, and the country is now a presidential republic consisting of 17 administrative divisions.
South Korea is a highly developed country and a high-income economy, with a ""very high"" Human Development Index, ranking 22nd in the world. The country is considered a regional power and is the world's 11th largest economy by nominal GDP and the 12th largest by PPP as of 2010. South Korea is a global leader in the industrial and technological sectors, being the world's 5th largest exporter and 8th largest importer. Its export-driven economy primarily focuses production on electronics, automobiles, ships, machinery, petrochemicals and robotics. South Korea is a member of the ASEAN Plus mechanism, the United Nations, Uniting for Consensus, G20, the WTO and OECD and is a founding member of APEC and the East Asia Summit.","['1948 establishments in South Korea', 'All Wikipedia articles in need of updating', 'All articles containing potentially dated statements', 'All articles with dead external links', 'All articles with self-published sources', 'All articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Articles containing Korean-language text', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2005', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2010', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2016', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2018', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from May 2009', 'Articles with Curlie links', 'Articles with French-language external links', 'Articles with Korean-language external links', 'Articles with dead external links from April 2017', 'Articles with dead external links from February 2009', 'Articles with dead external links from July 2017', 'Articles with hAudio microformats', 'Articles with obsolete information from March 2012', 'Articles with permanently dead external links', 'Articles with self-published sources from December 2017', 'Articles with short description', 'Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from May 2012', 'Articles with unsourced statements from June 2018', 'CS1 Chinese-language sources (zh)', 'CS1 Korean-language sources (ko)', 'CS1 maint: BOT: original-url status unknown', 'CS1 uses Chinese-language script (zh)', 'CS1 uses Korean-language script (ko)', 'Coordinates on Wikidata', 'East Asian countries', 'G20 nations', 'Korea', 'Korean-speaking countries and territories', 'Member states of the United Nations', 'Northeast Asian countries', 'Official website different in Wikidata and Wikipedia', 'Pages using infobox country or infobox former country with the symbol caption or type parameters', 'Republics', 'South Korea', 'States and territories established in 1948', 'Use mdy dates from November 2017', 'Webarchive template wayback links', 'Webarchive template webcite links', 'Wikipedia articles incorporating text from the World Factbook', 'Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with MusicBrainz area identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with WorldCat-VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages']",['Romance'],KBS2,"Cho Mi Jin is a new employee of an apparel company who later then becomes the daughter-in-law of a family running a pork hock restaurant with a 60 year old tradition.

304,City of the Sun,"South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (ROK), is a country in East Asia, constituting the southern part of the Korean Peninsula and lying to the east of the Asian mainland. The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time, ruling most of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia, under Gwanggaeto the Great. South Korea lies in the north temperate zone and has a predominantly mountainous terrain. It comprises an estimated 51.4 million residents distributed over 100,363 km2 (38,750 sq mi). Its capital and largest city is Seoul, with a population of around 10 million.
Archaeology indicates that the Korean Peninsula was inhabited by early humans starting from the Lower Paleolithic period (2.6 Ma–300 Ka). The history of Korea begins with the foundation of Gojoseon in 2333 BCE by the mythic king Dangun, but no archaeological evidence and writing was found from this period. The Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in 11th century BCE, and its existence and role has been controversial in the modern era. The written historical record on Gojoseon (Old Joseon) was first mentioned in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under Unified Silla in CE 668, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910). It was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. At the end of World War II, Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S. zones of occupations. A separate election was held in the U.S. zone in 1948 which led to the creation of the Republic of Korea (ROK), while the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was established in the Soviet zone. The United Nations at the time passed a resolution declaring the ROK to be the only lawful government in Korea.The Korean War began in June 1950 when forces from North Korea invaded South Korea. The war lasted three years and involved the U.S., China, the Soviet Union and several other nations. The border between the two nations remains the most heavily fortified in the world. Under long-time military leader Park Chung-hee, the South Korean economy grew significantly and the country was transformed into a G-20 major economy. Military rule ended in 1987, and the country is now a presidential republic consisting of 17 administrative divisions.
South Korea is a highly developed country and a high-income economy, with a ""very high"" Human Development Index, ranking 22nd in the world. The country is considered a regional power and is the world's 11th largest economy by nominal GDP and the 12th largest by PPP as of 2010. South Korea is a global leader in the industrial and technological sectors, being the world's 5th largest exporter and 8th largest importer. Its export-driven economy primarily focuses production on electronics, automobiles, ships, machinery, petrochemicals and robotics. South Korea is a member of the ASEAN Plus mechanism, the United Nations, Uniting for Consensus, G20, the WTO and OECD and is a founding member of APEC and the East Asia Summit.","['1948 establishments in South Korea', 'All Wikipedia articles in need of updating', 'All articles containing potentially dated statements', 'All articles with dead external links', 'All articles with self-published sources', 'All articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Articles containing Korean-language text', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2005', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2010', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2016', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2018', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from May 2009', 'Articles with Curlie links', 'Articles with French-language external links', 'Articles with Korean-language external links', 'Articles with dead external links from April 2017', 'Articles with dead external links from February 2009', 'Articles with dead external links from July 2017', 'Articles with hAudio microformats', 'Articles with obsolete information from March 2012', 'Articles with permanently dead external links', 'Articles with self-published sources from December 2017', 'Articles with short description', 'Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from May 2012', 'Articles with unsourced statements from June 2018', 'CS1 Chinese-language sources (zh)', 'CS1 Korean-language sources (ko)', 'CS1 maint: BOT: original-url status unknown', 'CS1 uses Chinese-language script (zh)', 'CS1 uses Korean-language script (ko)', 'Coordinates on Wikidata', 'East Asian countries', 'G20 nations', 'Korea', 'Korean-speaking countries and territories', 'Member states of the United Nations', 'Northeast Asian countries', 'Official website different in Wikidata and Wikipedia', 'Pages using infobox country or infobox former country with the symbol caption or type parameters', 'Republics', 'South Korea', 'States and territories established in 1948', 'Use mdy dates from November 2017', 'Webarchive template wayback links', 'Webarchive template webcite links', 'Wikipedia articles incorporating text from the World Factbook', 'Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with MusicBrainz area identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with WorldCat-VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages']","['Legal', 'Melodrama', 'Mystery']",MBC Dramanet,"This drama is based on a Japanese Novel “<a href=""http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%89%84%E3%81%AE%E9%AA%A8"" target=""_blank"">てつのほね / 鉄の骨</a>” by “<a href=""http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%B1%A0%E4%BA%95%E6%88%B8%E6%BD%A4"" target=""_blank"">いけいど じゅん / 池井戸潤</a>” which was then adapted into a Japanese drama in 2010.</p><p>The drama is about a young man, Kang Tae Yang (<a href=""http://star.koreandrama.org/?p=1138"" target=""_blank"">Kim Joon</a>) who works at a construction company and harbors ideals of building people homes to live in, only to find that his company is engaged in corrupt activities."

311,Love Cells (Season 2),"South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (ROK), is a country in East Asia, constituting the southern part of the Korean Peninsula and lying to the east of the Asian mainland. The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time, ruling most of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia, under Gwanggaeto the Great. South Korea lies in the north temperate zone and has a predominantly mountainous terrain. It comprises an estimated 51.4 million residents distributed over 100,363 km2 (38,750 sq mi). Its capital and largest city is Seoul, with a population of around 10 million.
Archaeology indicates that the Korean Peninsula was inhabited by early humans starting from the Lower Paleolithic period (2.6 Ma–300 Ka). The history of Korea begins with the foundation of Gojoseon in 2333 BCE by the mythic king Dangun, but no archaeological evidence and writing was found from this period. The Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in 11th century BCE, and its existence and role has been controversial in the modern era. The written historical record on Gojoseon (Old Joseon) was first mentioned in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under Unified Silla in CE 668, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910). It was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. At the end of World War II, Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S. zones of occupations. A separate election was held in the U.S. zone in 1948 which led to the creation of the Republic of Korea (ROK), while the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was established in the Soviet zone. The United Nations at the time passed a resolution declaring the ROK to be the only lawful government in Korea.The Korean War began in June 1950 when forces from North Korea invaded South Korea. The war lasted three years and involved the U.S., China, the Soviet Union and several other nations. The border between the two nations remains the most heavily fortified in the world. Under long-time military leader Park Chung-hee, the South Korean economy grew significantly and the country was transformed into a G-20 major economy. Military rule ended in 1987, and the country is now a presidential republic consisting of 17 administrative divisions.
South Korea is a highly developed country and a high-income economy, with a ""very high"" Human Development Index, ranking 22nd in the world. The country is considered a regional power and is the world's 11th largest economy by nominal GDP and the 12th largest by PPP as of 2010. South Korea is a global leader in the industrial and technological sectors, being the world's 5th largest exporter and 8th largest importer. Its export-driven economy primarily focuses production on electronics, automobiles, ships, machinery, petrochemicals and robotics. South Korea is a member of the ASEAN Plus mechanism, the United Nations, Uniting for Consensus, G20, the WTO and OECD and is a founding member of APEC and the East Asia Summit.","['1948 establishments in South Korea', 'All Wikipedia articles in need of updating', 'All articles containing potentially dated statements', 'All articles with dead external links', 'All articles with self-published sources', 'All articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Articles containing Korean-language text', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2005', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2010', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2016', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2018', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from May 2009', 'Articles with Curlie links', 'Articles with French-language external links', 'Articles with Korean-language external links', 'Articles with dead external links from April 2017', 'Articles with dead external links from February 2009', 'Articles with dead external links from July 2017', 'Articles with hAudio microformats', 'Articles with obsolete information from March 2012', 'Articles with permanently dead external links', 'Articles with self-published sources from December 2017', 'Articles with short description', 'Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from May 2012', 'Articles with unsourced statements from June 2018', 'CS1 Chinese-language sources (zh)', 'CS1 Korean-language sources (ko)', 'CS1 maint: BOT: original-url status unknown', 'CS1 uses Chinese-language script (zh)', 'CS1 uses Korean-language script (ko)', 'Coordinates on Wikidata', 'East Asian countries', 'G20 nations', 'Korea', 'Korean-speaking countries and territories', 'Member states of the United Nations', 'Northeast Asian countries', 'Official website different in Wikidata and Wikipedia', 'Pages using infobox country or infobox former country with the symbol caption or type parameters', 'Republics', 'South Korea', 'States and territories established in 1948', 'Use mdy dates from November 2017', 'Webarchive template wayback links', 'Webarchive template webcite links', 'Wikipedia articles incorporating text from the World Factbook', 'Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with MusicBrainz area identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with WorldCat-VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages']","['Romance', 'Comedy', 'Fantasy']",NAVER tvcast,"This Web drama is based on the popular Webtoon <em>“<a href=""http://comic.naver.com/webtoon/list.nhn?titleId=191347"" target=""_blank"">Love Cells</a>“</em> by <em>“김명현 (Kim Myung Hyun)”</em> which was published from 2010-July-21 to 2010-Sep-22.</p><p>In this bitter sweet love story, Navi (<a href=""http://star.koreandrama.org/?p=1850"" target=""_blank"">Kim Yoo Jung</a>) acts like a navigation of love relationship.

319,Maybe Love,"""Call Me Maybe"" is a song recorded by Canadian singer-songwriter Carly Rae Jepsen for her EP Curiosity (2012) which also appears on her second studio album, Kiss (2012). The song was written by Jepsen and Tavish Crowe as a folk song, but its genre was modified to pop following the production by Josh Ramsay. It was released as the lead single from the EP on September 20, 2011, through 604 Records. Jepsen was signed to Schoolboy Records, releasing her single in the United States through the label, as the first single from Kiss. Musically, ""Call Me Maybe"" is a pop and teen pop track that alludes to the inconvenience that a love at first sight brings to a girl who hopes for a call back from a new crush.
""Call Me Maybe"" reached number one in Australia, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Hungary, Ireland, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Poland, Slovakia, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States, while peaking inside the top three in Austria, Belgium (Flanders & Wallonia), Germany, Israel, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden. After reaching the top position on the Canadian Hot 100, Jepsen became only the fifth Canadian artist to do so in her home country since 2007. In the United States, the track reached number one on the Mainstream Top 40 chart, and is the first number one by a Canadian female artist on the Billboard Hot 100 chart since 2007's ""Girlfriend"" by Avril Lavigne.
An accompanying music video was directed by Ben Knechtel. In it, Jepsen seeks the attention of an attractive boy next door who is revealed at the close of the story to be attracted to a male band member. As part of promotion for the song, Jepsen performed the track on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, where she made her US television debut, and at the 2012 Billboard Music Awards. ""Call Me Maybe"" has been covered by several artists, including Big Time Rush, Fun, Cimorelli, Lil Wayne, JPEGMAFIA, and Cody Simpson, and parodied by Cookie Monster and some of the news staff of National Public Radio. It was also covered on ""The New Rachel"", the season premiere episode of the fourth season of Glee.
""Call Me Maybe"" was nominated for two Grammy Awards, for Song of the Year and Best Pop Solo Performance at the 55th Annual ceremony, but lost to ""We Are Young"" by Fun and the live performance of ""Set Fire to the Rain"" by Adele, respectively. On December 11, 2012, ""Call Me Maybe"" was named Song of the Year for 2012 by MTV. In its 2012 Year-End issue, Billboard magazine ranked this song #2 in the Hot 100 Songs, Digital Songs, and Canadian Hot 100 charts, in each case behind ""Somebody That I Used to Know"", by Gotye featuring Kimbra. The song was also ranked number one by the Village Voice's annual Pazz and Jop poll, which compiles the votes of music critics from all over the United States. The song was the best-selling single worldwide in 2012, selling over 12 million copies in that year alone, and the best-selling single on the iTunes Store in 2012. With worldwide sales, quoted in one source in July 2015 as over 18 million copies, it became the best selling single of the century by a female artist. ""Call Me Maybe"" was the best-selling digital single of 2012, and is the seventh best-selling digital single of all time. The song is ranked at #47 on Billboard's Greatest Songs of All-Time.

324,Powerful Opponents,"South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (ROK), is a country in East Asia, constituting the southern part of the Korean Peninsula and lying to the east of the Asian mainland. The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time, ruling most of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia, under Gwanggaeto the Great. South Korea lies in the north temperate zone and has a predominantly mountainous terrain. It comprises an estimated 51.4 million residents distributed over 100,363 km2 (38,750 sq mi). Its capital and largest city is Seoul, with a population of around 10 million.
Archaeology indicates that the Korean Peninsula was inhabited by early humans starting from the Lower Paleolithic period (2.6 Ma–300 Ka). The history of Korea begins with the foundation of Gojoseon in 2333 BCE by the mythic king Dangun, but no archaeological evidence and writing was found from this period. The Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in 11th century BCE, and its existence and role has been controversial in the modern era. The written historical record on Gojoseon (Old Joseon) was first mentioned in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under Unified Silla in CE 668, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910). It was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. At the end of World War II, Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S. zones of occupations. A separate election was held in the U.S. zone in 1948 which led to the creation of the Republic of Korea (ROK), while the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was established in the Soviet zone. The United Nations at the time passed a resolution declaring the ROK to be the only lawful government in Korea.The Korean War began in June 1950 when forces from North Korea invaded South Korea. The war lasted three years and involved the U.S., China, the Soviet Union and several other nations. The border between the two nations remains the most heavily fortified in the world. Under long-time military leader Park Chung-hee, the South Korean economy grew significantly and the country was transformed into a G-20 major economy. Military rule ended in 1987, and the country is now a presidential republic consisting of 17 administrative divisions.
South Korea is a highly developed country and a high-income economy, with a ""very high"" Human Development Index, ranking 22nd in the world. The country is considered a regional power and is the world's 11th largest economy by nominal GDP and the 12th largest by PPP as of 2010. South Korea is a global leader in the industrial and technological sectors, being the world's 5th largest exporter and 8th largest importer. Its export-driven economy primarily focuses production on electronics, automobiles, ships, machinery, petrochemicals and robotics. South Korea is a member of the ASEAN Plus mechanism, the United Nations, Uniting for Consensus, G20, the WTO and OECD and is a founding member of APEC and the East Asia Summit.","['1948 establishments in South Korea', 'All Wikipedia articles in need of updating', 'All articles containing potentially dated statements', 'All articles with dead external links', 'All articles with self-published sources', 'All articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Articles containing Korean-language text', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2005', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2010', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2016', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2018', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from May 2009', 'Articles with Curlie links', 'Articles with French-language external links', 'Articles with Korean-language external links', 'Articles with dead external links from April 2017', 'Articles with dead external links from February 2009', 'Articles with dead external links from July 2017', 'Articles with hAudio microformats', 'Articles with obsolete information from March 2012', 'Articles with permanently dead external links', 'Articles with self-published sources from December 2017', 'Articles with short description', 'Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from May 2012', 'Articles with unsourced statements from June 2018', 'CS1 Chinese-language sources (zh)', 'CS1 Korean-language sources (ko)', 'CS1 maint: BOT: original-url status unknown', 'CS1 uses Chinese-language script (zh)', 'CS1 uses Korean-language script (ko)', 'Coordinates on Wikidata', 'East Asian countries', 'G20 nations', 'Korea', 'Korean-speaking countries and territories', 'Member states of the United Nations', 'Northeast Asian countries', 'Official website different in Wikidata and Wikipedia', 'Pages using infobox country or infobox former country with the symbol caption or type parameters', 'Republics', 'South Korea', 'States and territories established in 1948', 'Use mdy dates from November 2017', 'Webarchive template wayback links', 'Webarchive template webcite links', 'Wikipedia articles incorporating text from the World Factbook', 'Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with MusicBrainz area identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with WorldCat-VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages']",['Romance'],KBS2,"Cha Young Jin is the first female to ever work as a bodyguard in the Presidential resident, Chungwadae.

Single-member constituencies comprise 253 of the assembly's seats, while the remaining 47 are allocated by proportional representation. Members serve four-year terms.
The unicameral assembly consists of at least 200 members according to the South Korean constitution. In 1990 the assembly had 299 seats, 224 of which were directly elected from single-member districts in the general elections of April 1988. Under applicable laws, the remaining seventy-five representatives were elected from party lists. By law, candidates for election to the assembly must be at least thirty years of age. As part of a political compromise in 1987, an earlier requirement that candidates have at least five years' continuous residency in the country was dropped to allow Kim Dae-Jung, who had spent several years in exile in Japan and the United States during the 1980s, to return to political life. The National Assembly's term is four years. In a change from the more authoritarian Fourth Republic and Fifth Republic (1972–80 and 1980–87, respectively), under the Sixth Republic, the assembly cannot be dissolved by the president.","['Articles containing Korean-language text', 'Articles with short description', 'CS1 German-language sources (de)', 'Government of South Korea', 'National Assembly (South Korea)', 'National legislatures', 'Unicameral legislatures', 'Use dmy dates from March 2012', 'Webarchive template wayback links']","['Historical', 'Politic']",KBS2,"A drama about Jeong Chi Seong (<a href=""http://star.koreandrama.org/?p=1266"" target=""_blank"">Yoo Oh Sung</a>), a former prosecuter and current third line mid-level member of Parliament who gets abandoned in an island."

348,To Be Continued,"South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (ROK), is a country in East Asia, constituting the southern part of the Korean Peninsula and lying to the east of the Asian mainland. The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time, ruling most of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia, under Gwanggaeto the Great. South Korea lies in the north temperate zone and has a predominantly mountainous terrain. It comprises an estimated 51.4 million residents distributed over 100,363 km2 (38,750 sq mi). Its capital and largest city is Seoul, with a population of around 10 million.
Archaeology indicates that the Korean Peninsula was inhabited by early humans starting from the Lower Paleolithic period (2.6 Ma–300 Ka). The history of Korea begins with the foundation of Gojoseon in 2333 BCE by the mythic king Dangun, but no archaeological evidence and writing was found from this period. The Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in 11th century BCE, and its existence and role has been controversial in the modern era. The written historical record on Gojoseon (Old Joseon) was first mentioned in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under Unified Silla in CE 668, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910). It was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. At the end of World War II, Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S. zones of occupations. A separate election was held in the U.S. zone in 1948 which led to the creation of the Republic of Korea (ROK), while the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was established in the Soviet zone. The United Nations at the time passed a resolution declaring the ROK to be the only lawful government in Korea.The Korean War began in June 1950 when forces from North Korea invaded South Korea. The war lasted three years and involved the U.S., China, the Soviet Union and several other nations. The border between the two nations remains the most heavily fortified in the world. Under long-time military leader Park Chung-hee, the South Korean economy grew significantly and the country was transformed into a G-20 major economy. Military rule ended in 1987, and the country is now a presidential republic consisting of 17 administrative divisions.
South Korea is a highly developed country and a high-income economy, with a ""very high"" Human Development Index, ranking 22nd in the world. The country is considered a regional power and is the world's 11th largest economy by nominal GDP and the 12th largest by PPP as of 2010. South Korea is a global leader in the industrial and technological sectors, being the world's 5th largest exporter and 8th largest importer. Its export-driven economy primarily focuses production on electronics, automobiles, ships, machinery, petrochemicals and robotics.

353,Fermentation Family,"Korea is a region in East Asia. Since 1948, it has been divided between two distinct sovereign states: North Korea and South Korea. Korea consists of the Korean Peninsula, Jeju Island, and several minor islands near the peninsula. Korea is bordered by China to the northwest, Russia to the northeast, and neighbours Japan to the east by the Korea Strait and the Sea of Japan (East Sea).
During the first half of the 1st millennium, Korea was divided between the three competing states of Baekje, Goguryeo, and Silla, together known as the ""Three Kingdoms of Korea"". In the second half of the 1st millennium, Baekje and Goguryeo were conquered by Silla, leading to the ""Unified Silla"" period. Meanwhile, Balhae formed in the north following the collapse of Goguryeo. Unified Silla eventually collapsed into three separate states due to civil war, ushering in the Later Three Kingdoms. Toward the end of the 1st millennium Goryeo, which was a revival of Goguryeo, defeated the two other states and unified the Korean Peninsula as one single state. Around the same time, Balhae collapsed and its last crown prince fled south to Goryeo. Goryeo (also spelled as Koryŏ), whose name developed into the modern exonym ""Korea"", was a highly cultured state that created the world's first metal movable type in 1234. However, multiple invasions by the Mongol Empire during the 13th century greatly weakened the nation, which eventually agreed to become a vassal state after decades of fighting. Following military resistance under King Gongmin which ended Mongol political influence in Goryeo, severe political strife followed, and Goryeo eventually fell to a coup led by General Yi Seong-gye, who established Joseon in 1392.
The first 200 years of Joseon were marked by relative peace. During this period, the Korean alphabet was created by Sejong the Great in the 15th century and there was increasing influence of Confucianism. During the later part of the dynasty, Korea's isolationist policy earned it the Western nickname of the ""Hermit Kingdom"". By the late 19th century, the country became the object of imperial design by the Empire of Japan. After the First Sino-Japanese War, despite the Korean Empire's effort to modernize, it was annexed by Japan in 1910 and ruled by Imperial Japan until the end of World War II in August 1945.
In 1945, the Soviet Union and the United States agreed on the surrender of Japanese forces in Korea in the aftermath of World War II, leaving Korea partitioned along the 38th parallel. The North was under Soviet occupation and the South under U.S. occupation. These circumstances soon became the basis for the division of Korea by the two superpowers, exacerbated by their inability to agree on the terms of Korean independence. The Communist-inspired government in the North received backing from the Soviet Union in opposition to the pro-Western government in the South, leading to Korea's division into two political entities: North Korea (officially the Democratic People's Republic of Korea), and South Korea (officially the Republic of Korea). Tensions between the two resulted in the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950. With involvement by foreign troops, the war ended in a stalemate in 1953, but without a formalized peace treaty. This status contributes to the high tensions that continue to divide the peninsula. Both governments of the two Koreas claim to be the sole legitimate government of the region.","['All articles with self-published sources', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Articles containing Chinese-language text', 'Articles containing Japanese-language text', 'Articles containing Korean-language text', 'Articles containing Vietnamese-language text', 'Articles with Curlie links', 'Articles with self-published sources from December 2017', 'Articles with short description', 'Articles with unsourced statements from April 2013', 'Articles with unsourced statements from April 2017', 'Articles with unsourced statements from October 2014', 'CS1: Julian–Gregorian uncertainty', 'CS1 French-language sources (fr)', 'CS1 Korean-language sources (ko)', 'Coordinates on Wikidata', 'Disputed territories in Asia', 'Divided regions', 'East Asia', 'Korea', 'Korean-speaking countries and territories', 'Northeast Asia', 'Pages using infobox country or infobox former country with the symbol caption or type parameters', 'Use dmy dates from September 2015', 'Webarchive template wayback links', 'Webarchive template webcite links', ""Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from Collier's Encyclopedia"", 'Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the Encyclopedia Americana with a Wikisource reference', 'Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with WorldCat-VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia indefinitely move-protected pages', 'Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages']","['Family', 'Romance']",jTBC,"Set within the famous Korean restaurant Chunjiin, known especially for their kimchi dish.

The council, which he appointed himself along with other junta members, has the power to name the prime minister and control prime ministerial positions.
Prayut ran for Prime Minister in the 2019 Thai elections, which critics said he had an unfair advantage in over the other democratic parties due to the new bicameral system adopted in the 2017 constitution. As journalist Tom Evans has said, this election with either determine Thai’s return to democracy or it sliding further into authoritarianism.Prayut is a former Commander in Chief of the Royal Thai Army, the post he held from October 2010 to October 2014. After his appointment as army chief, Prayut was characterised as a strong royalist and an opponent of former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Considered a hardliner within the military, he was one of the leading proponents of military crackdowns on the Red Shirt demonstrations of April 2009 and April–May 2010. He later sought to moderate his profile, talking to relatives of protesters who were killed in the bloody conflict, and co-operating with the government of Yingluck Shinawatra who won parliamentary elections in July 2011.
During the political crisis that began in November 2013 and involved protests against the caretaker government of Yingluck, Prayut claimed that the army was neutral, and would not launch a coup. However in May 2014, Prayut staged a military coup against the government and then assumed control of the country as NCPO leader. He later issued an interim constitution granting himself sweeping powers and giving himself amnesty for staging the coup. In August 2014, a military-dominated national legislature, whose members were handpicked by Prayut, non-democratically appointed him Prime Minister.After seizing power, Prayut deemed it necessary to crackdown on dissent for the sake of public order. He introduced the “twelve values” that he formulated based on traditional Thai values and suggested that these values be included in school lessons. Certain measures were implemented to limit public discussions about democracy and criticism of the government that might instigate further hatred and conflict.Prayut will be Phalang Pracharat's candidate for prime minister in the upcoming election.","['1954 births', '2010s in Thailand', '21st-century Thai people', 'All NPOV disputes', 'All articles covered by WikiProject Wikify', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'All pages needing cleanup', 'Army Commanders of the Royal Thai Army', 'Army United F.C.', 'Articles containing Thai-language text', 'Articles covered by WikiProject Wikify from January 2019', 'Articles with multiple maintenance issues', 'Articles with unsourced statements from March 2019', 'CS1: long volume value', 'CS1 French-language sources (fr)', 'CS1 Thai-language sources (th)', 'CS1 errors: external links', 'CS1 maint: Extra text: authors list', 'CS1 uses Thai-language script (th)', 'Chulachomklao Royal Military Academy alumni', 'Commons category link is on Wikidata', 'EngvarB from November 2016', 'Leaders who took power by coup', 'Living people', 'NPOV disputes from October 2018', 'People from Nakhon Ratchasima Province', 'Prime Ministers of Thailand', 'Thai generals', 'Use dmy dates from November 2016', 'Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with WorldCat-VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia introduction cleanup from January 2019']","['Family', 'Romance']",,"Two women became widows on the same day, same hour.

415,The Miracle,"The Miracle on the Han River refers to the period of rapid economic growth in South Korea following the Korean War (1950–1953), during which South Korea transformed from a developing country to a developed country. The rapid reconstruction and development of the South Korean economy during the latter half of the 20th century was accompanied by events such as the country's successful hosting of the 1988 Summer Olympics and its co-hosting of the 2002 FIFA World Cup, as well as the ascension of family-owned conglomerates known as chaebols, such as Samsung, LG, and Hyundai.The term ""Miracle on the Han River"" was coined after the phrase ""Miracle on the Rhine"" was used to refer to the economic rebirth of West Germany after World War II. This analogy was incorporated by Chang Myon, prime minister of the Second Republic of South Korea, in his New Year's address of 1961, in which he encouraged South Koreans to bear difficulties in the hope of achieving a similar economic upturn. The resultant growth has been attributed to the hard work of the labour force, in terms of which the phrase's use of ""miracle"" may be seen as a misnomer. Following the Miracle on the Han River, South Korea has been held as an economic model for other developing countriesand acceded to the G20 in November 2010, capping a successful sixty-some years of rebuilding and modernization.","['1950s in Seoul', '20th century in South Korea', 'All articles needing additional references', 'All articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Articles containing Korean-language text', 'Articles needing additional references from May 2016', 'Articles with short description', 'Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from November 2018', 'Articles with unsourced statements from May 2013', 'Economic booms', 'Economic history of South Korea', 'Economy of South Korea', 'Wikipedia articles needing clarification from November 2018']",['Webdrama'],NAVER tvcast,"How could twin sisters be such polar opposites?

416,Unique Daughters-in-Law,"South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (ROK), is a country in East Asia, constituting the southern part of the Korean Peninsula and lying to the east of the Asian mainland. The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time, ruling most of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia, under Gwanggaeto the Great. South Korea lies in the north temperate zone and has a predominantly mountainous terrain. It comprises an estimated 51.4 million residents distributed over 100,363 km2 (38,750 sq mi). Its capital and largest city is Seoul, with a population of around 10 million.
Archaeology indicates that the Korean Peninsula was inhabited by early humans starting from the Lower Paleolithic period (2.6 Ma–300 Ka). The history of Korea begins with the foundation of Gojoseon in 2333 BCE by the mythic king Dangun, but no archaeological evidence and writing was found from this period. The Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in 11th century BCE, and its existence and role has been controversial in the modern era. The written historical record on Gojoseon (Old Joseon) was first mentioned in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under Unified Silla in CE 668, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910). It was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. At the end of World War II, Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S. zones of occupations. A separate election was held in the U.S. zone in 1948 which led to the creation of the Republic of Korea (ROK), while the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was established in the Soviet zone. The United Nations at the time passed a resolution declaring the ROK to be the only lawful government in Korea.The Korean War began in June 1950 when forces from North Korea invaded South Korea. The war lasted three years and involved the U.S., China, the Soviet Union and several other nations. The border between the two nations remains the most heavily fortified in the world. Under long-time military leader Park Chung-hee, the South Korean economy grew significantly and the country was transformed into a G-20 major economy. Military rule ended in 1987, and the country is now a presidential republic consisting of 17 administrative divisions.
South Korea is a highly developed country and a high-income economy, with a ""very high"" Human Development Index, ranking 22nd in the world. The country is considered a regional power and is the world's 11th largest economy by nominal GDP and the 12th largest by PPP as of 2010. South Korea is a global leader in the industrial and technological sectors, being the world's 5th largest exporter and 8th largest importer. Its export-driven economy primarily focuses production on electronics, automobiles, ships, machinery, petrochemicals and robotics. South Korea is a member of the ASEAN Plus mechanism, the United Nations, Uniting for Consensus, G20, the WTO and OECD and is a founding member of APEC and the East Asia Summit.","['1948 establishments in South Korea', 'All Wikipedia articles in need of updating', 'All articles containing potentially dated statements', 'All articles with dead external links', 'All articles with self-published sources', 'All articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Articles containing Korean-language text', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2005', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2010', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2016', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2018', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from May 2009', 'Articles with Curlie links', 'Articles with French-language external links', 'Articles with Korean-language external links', 'Articles with dead external links from April 2017', 'Articles with dead external links from February 2009', 'Articles with dead external links from July 2017', 'Articles with hAudio microformats', 'Articles with obsolete information from March 2012', 'Articles with permanently dead external links', 'Articles with self-published sources from December 2017', 'Articles with short description', 'Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from May 2012', 'Articles with unsourced statements from June 2018', 'CS1 Chinese-language sources (zh)', 'CS1 Korean-language sources (ko)', 'CS1 maint: BOT: original-url status unknown', 'CS1 uses Chinese-language script (zh)', 'CS1 uses Korean-language script (ko)', 'Coordinates on Wikidata', 'East Asian countries', 'G20 nations', 'Korea', 'Korean-speaking countries and territories', 'Member states of the United Nations', 'Northeast Asian countries', 'Official website different in Wikidata and Wikipedia', 'Pages using infobox country or infobox former country with the symbol caption or type parameters', 'Republics', 'South Korea', 'States and territories established in 1948', 'Use mdy dates from November 2017', 'Webarchive template wayback links', 'Webarchive template webcite links', 'Wikipedia articles incorporating text from the World Factbook', 'Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with MusicBrainz area identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with WorldCat-VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages']","['Family', 'Romance']",MBC,"Hwang Eun Byul (<a href=""http://star.koreandrama.org/ham-eun-jung/"" target=""_blank"">Ham Eun Jung</a>), a ghostwriter for a publishing company, and Hwang Geum Byul (<a href=""http://star.koreandrama.org/lee-joo-yeon/"" target=""_blank"">Lee Joo Yeon</a>), a leader for the PR department at a fashion company, are fraternal twin sisters, but their mother has always favored Geum Byul.

KBS series Drama City finished its run in 2008 after 14 years in Korea. Since then, dramas adapted from comic books or online novels rose to the mainstream, leaving even less space for short dramas to make a comeback. However, on May 15, 2010, single-episode series made a comeback through 24-part KBS Drama Special's first episode Red Candy by veteran scriptwriter Noh Hee-kyung.","['Articles containing Korean-language text', 'Articles with Korean-language external links', 'Articles with short description', 'CS1 Korean-language sources (ko)', 'Interlanguage link template link number', 'Korean-language television programs', 'Korean Broadcasting System television dramas']",['NaN'],KBS2,"><p><img alt="""" class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-11630"" height=""256"" sizes=""(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px"" src=""https://www.koreandrama.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/KBS-Drama-Special.jpg"" srcset=""https://www.koreandrama.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/KBS-Drama-Special.jpg 256w, https://www.koreandrama.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/KBS-Drama-Special-150x150.jpg 150w"" title=""KBS Drama Special"" width=""256""/></p><p>Title: 드라마 스페셜 2013 / KBS Drama Special 2013<br/> Broadcast network: KBS2<br/> Broadcast period: 2013-June-12 to 2013-Dec-08<br/> Air time: Wednesday 23:20 or Sunday 23:20 <em>(start from 2013-Nov-03)</em><br/> Related Drama: <a href=""https://www.koreandrama.org/?tag=kbs-drama-special"" target=""_blank"">KBS Drama Special</a></p><p><span id=""more-27110""></span></p><p><strong>About KBS Drama Special 2013</strong></p><p>KBS Drama Special 2013 is an anthology series that features different stories, cast members and production teams each week, and is presented single episodes.</p><p><strong>Episode Title</strong></p><p></p><table cellspacing=""1"" class=""wptable rowstyle-alt"" id=""wptable-293""><thead><tr><th align=""center"" class=""sortable"" style=""width:80px"">Date</th><th align=""center"" class=""sortable"" style=""width:320px"">Episode Title</th></tr></thead><tr><td align=""center"" style=""width:80px"">2013-06-12</td><td align=""center"" style=""width:320px"">내 낡은 지갑 속의 기억 / A Faded Memory</td></tr><tr class=""alt""><td align=""center"" style=""width:80px"">2013-06-19</td><td align=""center"" style=""width:320px"">내 친구는 아직 살아있다 / My Friend Is Still Alive</td></tr><tr><td align=""center"" style=""width:80px"">2013-06-26</td><td align=""center"" style=""width:320px"">유리반창고 / Glass Bandage</td></tr><tr class=""alt""><td align=""center"" style=""width:80px"">2013-08-07</td><td align=""center"" style=""width:320px"">불침번을 서라 / Night Watch</td></tr><tr><td align=""center"" style=""width:80px"">2013-08-14</td><td align=""center"" style=""width:320px"">Happy! 로즈 데이 / Happy!

424,Eating Existence,"South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (ROK), is a country in East Asia, constituting the southern part of the Korean Peninsula and lying to the east of the Asian mainland. The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time, ruling most of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia, under Gwanggaeto the Great. South Korea lies in the north temperate zone and has a predominantly mountainous terrain. It comprises an estimated 51.4 million residents distributed over 100,363 km2 (38,750 sq mi). Its capital and largest city is Seoul, with a population of around 10 million.
Archaeology indicates that the Korean Peninsula was inhabited by early humans starting from the Lower Paleolithic period (2.6 Ma–300 Ka). The history of Korea begins with the foundation of Gojoseon in 2333 BCE by the mythic king Dangun, but no archaeological evidence and writing was found from this period. The Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in 11th century BCE, and its existence and role has been controversial in the modern era. The written historical record on Gojoseon (Old Joseon) was first mentioned in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under Unified Silla in CE 668, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910). It was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. At the end of World War II, Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S. zones of occupations. A separate election was held in the U.S. zone in 1948 which led to the creation of the Republic of Korea (ROK), while the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was established in the Soviet zone. The United Nations at the time passed a resolution declaring the ROK to be the only lawful government in Korea.The Korean War began in June 1950 when forces from North Korea invaded South Korea. The war lasted three years and involved the U.S., China, the Soviet Union and several other nations. The border between the two nations remains the most heavily fortified in the world. Under long-time military leader Park Chung-hee, the South Korean economy grew significantly and the country was transformed into a G-20 major economy. Military rule ended in 1987, and the country is now a presidential republic consisting of 17 administrative divisions.
South Korea is a highly developed country and a high-income economy, with a ""very high"" Human Development Index, ranking 22nd in the world. The country is considered a regional power and is the world's 11th largest economy by nominal GDP and the 12th largest by PPP as of 2010.

432,Short,"South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (ROK), is a country in East Asia, constituting the southern part of the Korean Peninsula and lying to the east of the Asian mainland. The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time, ruling most of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia, under Gwanggaeto the Great. South Korea lies in the north temperate zone and has a predominantly mountainous terrain. It comprises an estimated 51.4 million residents distributed over 100,363 km2 (38,750 sq mi). Its capital and largest city is Seoul, with a population of around 10 million.
Archaeology indicates that the Korean Peninsula was inhabited by early humans starting from the Lower Paleolithic period (2.6 Ma–300 Ka). The history of Korea begins with the foundation of Gojoseon in 2333 BCE by the mythic king Dangun, but no archaeological evidence and writing was found from this period. The Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in 11th century BCE, and its existence and role has been controversial in the modern era. The written historical record on Gojoseon (Old Joseon) was first mentioned in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under Unified Silla in CE 668, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910). It was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. At the end of World War II, Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S. zones of occupations. A separate election was held in the U.S. zone in 1948 which led to the creation of the Republic of Korea (ROK), while the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was established in the Soviet zone. The United Nations at the time passed a resolution declaring the ROK to be the only lawful government in Korea.The Korean War began in June 1950 when forces from North Korea invaded South Korea. The war lasted three years and involved the U.S., China, the Soviet Union and several other nations. The border between the two nations remains the most heavily fortified in the world. Under long-time military leader Park Chung-hee, the South Korean economy grew significantly and the country was transformed into a G-20 major economy. Military rule ended in 1987, and the country is now a presidential republic consisting of 17 administrative divisions.
South Korea is a highly developed country and a high-income economy, with a ""very high"" Human Development Index, ranking 22nd in the world. The country is considered a regional power and is the world's 11th largest economy by nominal GDP and the 12th largest by PPP as of 2010.

The legend dates back to the Middle Ages, the earliest references describing a piper, dressed in multicolored (""pied"") clothing, who was a rat-catcher hired by the town to lure rats away with his magic pipe. When the citizens refuse to pay for this service, he retaliates by using his instrument's magical power on their children, leading them away as he had the rats. This version of the story spread as folklore and has appeared in the writings of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, the Brothers Grimm, and Robert Browning, among others.
There are many contradictory theories about the Pied Piper. Some suggest he was a symbol of hope to the people of Hamelin, which had been attacked by plague; he drove the rats from Hamelin, saving the people from the epidemic.
 
The earliest known record of this story is from the town of Hamelin itself, depicted in a stained glass window created for the church of Hamelin, which dates to around 1300. Although the church was destroyed in 1660, several written accounts of the tale have survived.","['All articles needing additional references', 'All articles needing rewrite', 'All articles with failed verification', 'All articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Articles containing German-language text', 'Articles needing additional references from August 2015', 'Articles with failed verification from January 2019', 'Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from July 2016', 'Articles with unsourced statements from March 2017', 'Articles with unsourced statements from September 2015', 'Brothers Grimm', 'Commons category link is on Wikidata', 'Fictional flautists', 'Fictional kidnappers', 'German fairy tales', 'German folklore', 'German legends', 'Germany in fiction', 'Hamelin', 'Johann Wolfgang von Goethe', 'Legendary people', 'Medieval legends', 'Pied Piper of Hamelin', 'Robert Browning', 'Supernatural legends', 'Transylvania in fiction', 'Use dmy dates from April 2012', 'Victorian poetry', 'Webarchive template webcite links', 'Wikipedia articles needing rewrite from November 2018', 'Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with WorldCat-VIAF identifiers']","['Action', 'Thriller', 'Crime']",tvN,"Pied Piper focuses on a police negotiation task force that specializes in tense, worst-case scenarios that require highly trained communication.

473,"TV Novel – Waves, Waves","The Korean Wave (Hangul: 한류; Hanja: 韓流; RR: Hallyu; MR: Hallyu, listen , a neologism (literally meaning ""flow of Korea"") is the increase in global popularity of South Korean culture since the 1990s. First driven by the spread of K-dramas and K-pop across East, South and Southeast Asia during its initial stages, the Korean Wave evolved from a regional development into a global phenomenon, carried by the Internet and social media and the proliferation of K-pop music videos on YouTube. The term Hallyu was first used by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism in Korea in 1999, when the ministry produced a music CD titled in Chinese ""Hallyu—Song From Korea"". The term was adopted by Chinese media to describe the success of Korean popular culture in China.Since the turn of the 21st century, South Korea has emerged as a major exporter of popular culture and tourism, aspects which have become a significant part of its burgeoning economy. The growing popularity of Korean pop culture in many parts of the world has prompted the South Korean government to support its creative industries through subsidies and funding for start-ups, as a form of soft power and in its aim of becoming one of the world's leading exporters of culture along with Japanese and British culture, a niche that the United States has dominated for nearly a century. During this time, Korean society began to be recognized as developed on par with the Western world.The success of the Korean Wave owes in part to the development of social networking services and online video sharing platforms, which have allowed the Korean entertainment industry to reach a sizeable overseas audience. Use of these media in facilitating promotion, distribution, and consumption of various forms of Korean entertainment (and K-pop in particular) has contributed to their surge in worldwide popularity since the mid-2000s.The Korean Wave has become an influential global phenomenon since the start of the 21st century, heavily impacting the contemporary cultures, music industry, film industry, television industry, and behavioural aspects of various people throughout the world.","['All articles with dead external links', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Articles containing Chinese-language text', 'Articles containing Japanese-language text', 'Articles containing Korean-language text', 'Articles containing Vietnamese-language text', 'Articles containing video clips', 'Articles with dead external links from April 2018', 'Articles with hAudio microformats', 'Articles with permanently dead external links', 'Articles with unsourced statements from March 2018', 'CS1 Chinese-language sources (zh)', 'CS1 French-language sources (fr)', 'CS1 German-language sources (de)', 'CS1 Japanese-language sources (ja)', 'CS1 Korean-language sources (ko)', 'CS1 Turkish-language sources (tr)', 'CS1 maint: Archived copy as title', 'CS1 maint: Extra text: authors list', 'CS1 maint: Multiple names: authors list', 'CS1 uses Chinese-language script (zh)', 'CS1 uses Korean-language script (ko)', 'Commons category link from Wikidata', 'Korean nationalism', 'Pages with DOIs inactive since 2019', 'Pages with citations having bare URLs', 'Pages with citations lacking titles', 'Social movements in South Korea', 'South Korean popular culture', 'South Korean youth culture', 'Webarchive template wayback links']","['Melodrama', 'Family']",KBS2,

485,KBS Drama Special 2015,"KBS Drama Special (Hangul: 드라마 스페셜; RR: Deurama Seupesyeol) is a weekly program on KBS2 showing short dramas (usually single episodes), with each episode having a different story, cast, director, and writer. The format is based on Drama City and Best Theater.
KBS series Drama City finished its run in 2008 after 14 years in Korea. Since then, dramas adapted from comic books or online novels rose to the mainstream, leaving even less space for short dramas to make a comeback. However, on May 15, 2010, single-episode series made a comeback through 24-part KBS Drama Special's first episode Red Candy by veteran scriptwriter Noh Hee-kyung.","['Articles containing Korean-language text', 'Articles with Korean-language external links', 'Articles with short description', 'CS1 Korean-language sources (ko)', 'Interlanguage link template link number', 'Korean-language television programs', 'Korean Broadcasting System television dramas']",['NaN'],KBS2,"><p><img alt=""KBS Drama Special 2015 01"" class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-41468"" height=""256"" sizes=""(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px"" src=""https://www.koreandrama.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/KBS-Drama-Special-2015-01.jpg"" srcset=""https://www.koreandrama.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/KBS-Drama-Special-2015-01.jpg 256w, https://www.koreandrama.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/KBS-Drama-Special-2015-01-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.koreandrama.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/KBS-Drama-Special-2015-01-80x80.jpg 80w"" width=""256""/></p><p>Title: 드라마 스페셜 2015 / KBS Drama Special 2015<br/> Broadcast network: KBS2<br/> Broadcast period: 2015-March-13 to 2015-Nov-28<br/> Airtime: Friday 21:30<br/> Airtime: Friday 22:50 (from 2015-July-31)<br/> Airtime: Saturday 23:50 (from 2015-Oct-24)<br/> Related Drama: <a href=""https://www.koreandrama.org/?tag=kbs-drama-special"" target=""_blank"">KBS Drama Special</a></p><p><span id=""more-41433""></span></p><p><strong>About KBS Drama Special 2015</strong></p><p>KBS Drama Special 2015 is an anthology series that features different stories, cast members and production teams each week, and is presented two episodes.

494,Only You,"South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (ROK), is a country in East Asia, constituting the southern part of the Korean Peninsula and lying to the east of the Asian mainland. The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time, ruling most of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia, under Gwanggaeto the Great. South Korea lies in the north temperate zone and has a predominantly mountainous terrain. It comprises an estimated 51.4 million residents distributed over 100,363 km2 (38,750 sq mi). Its capital and largest city is Seoul, with a population of around 10 million.
Archaeology indicates that the Korean Peninsula was inhabited by early humans starting from the Lower Paleolithic period (2.6 Ma–300 Ka). The history of Korea begins with the foundation of Gojoseon in 2333 BCE by the mythic king Dangun, but no archaeological evidence and writing was found from this period. The Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in 11th century BCE, and its existence and role has been controversial in the modern era. The written historical record on Gojoseon (Old Joseon) was first mentioned in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under Unified Silla in CE 668, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910). It was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. At the end of World War II, Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S. zones of occupations. A separate election was held in the U.S. zone in 1948 which led to the creation of the Republic of Korea (ROK), while the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was established in the Soviet zone. The United Nations at the time passed a resolution declaring the ROK to be the only lawful government in Korea.The Korean War began in June 1950 when forces from North Korea invaded South Korea. The war lasted three years and involved the U.S., China, the Soviet Union and several other nations. The border between the two nations remains the most heavily fortified in the world. Under long-time military leader Park Chung-hee, the South Korean economy grew significantly and the country was transformed into a G-20 major economy. Military rule ended in 1987, and the country is now a presidential republic consisting of 17 administrative divisions.
South Korea is a highly developed country and a high-income economy, with a ""very high"" Human Development Index, ranking 22nd in the world. The country is considered a regional power and is the world's 11th largest economy by nominal GDP and the 12th largest by PPP as of 2010.

The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time, ruling most of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia, under Gwanggaeto the Great. South Korea lies in the north temperate zone and has a predominantly mountainous terrain. It comprises an estimated 51.4 million residents distributed over 100,363 km2 (38,750 sq mi). Its capital and largest city is Seoul, with a population of around 10 million.
Archaeology indicates that the Korean Peninsula was inhabited by early humans starting from the Lower Paleolithic period (2.6 Ma–300 Ka). The history of Korea begins with the foundation of Gojoseon in 2333 BCE by the mythic king Dangun, but no archaeological evidence and writing was found from this period. The Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in 11th century BCE, and its existence and role has been controversial in the modern era. The written historical record on Gojoseon (Old Joseon) was first mentioned in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under Unified Silla in CE 668, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910). It was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. At the end of World War II, Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S. zones of occupations. A separate election was held in the U.S. zone in 1948 which led to the creation of the Republic of Korea (ROK), while the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was established in the Soviet zone. The United Nations at the time passed a resolution declaring the ROK to be the only lawful government in Korea.The Korean War began in June 1950 when forces from North Korea invaded South Korea. The war lasted three years and involved the U.S., China, the Soviet Union and several other nations. The border between the two nations remains the most heavily fortified in the world.

511,9 End 2 Outs,"South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (ROK), is a country in East Asia, constituting the southern part of the Korean Peninsula and lying to the east of the Asian mainland. The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time, ruling most of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia, under Gwanggaeto the Great. South Korea lies in the north temperate zone and has a predominantly mountainous terrain. It comprises an estimated 51.4 million residents distributed over 100,363 km2 (38,750 sq mi). Its capital and largest city is Seoul, with a population of around 10 million.
Archaeology indicates that the Korean Peninsula was inhabited by early humans starting from the Lower Paleolithic period (2.6 Ma–300 Ka). The history of Korea begins with the foundation of Gojoseon in 2333 BCE by the mythic king Dangun, but no archaeological evidence and writing was found from this period. The Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in 11th century BCE, and its existence and role has been controversial in the modern era. The written historical record on Gojoseon (Old Joseon) was first mentioned in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under Unified Silla in CE 668, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910). It was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. At the end of World War II, Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S. zones of occupations. A separate election was held in the U.S. zone in 1948 which led to the creation of the Republic of Korea (ROK), while the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was established in the Soviet zone. The United Nations at the time passed a resolution declaring the ROK to be the only lawful government in Korea.The Korean War began in June 1950 when forces from North Korea invaded South Korea. The war lasted three years and involved the U.S., China, the Soviet Union and several other nations. The border between the two nations remains the most heavily fortified in the world. Under long-time military leader Park Chung-hee, the South Korean economy grew significantly and the country was transformed into a G-20 major economy. Military rule ended in 1987, and the country is now a presidential republic consisting of 17 administrative divisions.
South Korea is a highly developed country and a high-income economy, with a ""very high"" Human Development Index, ranking 22nd in the world. The country is considered a regional power and is the world's 11th largest economy by nominal GDP and the 12th largest by PPP as of 2010. South Korea is a global leader in the industrial and technological sectors, being the world's 5th largest exporter and 8th largest importer. Its export-driven economy primarily focuses production on electronics, automobiles, ships, machinery, petrochemicals and robotics. South Korea is a member of the ASEAN Plus mechanism, the United Nations, Uniting for Consensus, G20, the WTO and OECD and is a founding member of APEC and the East Asia Summit.","['1948 establishments in South Korea', 'All Wikipedia articles in need of updating', 'All articles containing potentially dated statements', 'All articles with dead external links', 'All articles with self-published sources', 'All articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Articles containing Korean-language text', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2005', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2010', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2016', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2018', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from May 2009', 'Articles with Curlie links', 'Articles with French-language external links', 'Articles with Korean-language external links', 'Articles with dead external links from April 2017', 'Articles with dead external links from February 2009', 'Articles with dead external links from July 2017', 'Articles with hAudio microformats', 'Articles with obsolete information from March 2012', 'Articles with permanently dead external links', 'Articles with self-published sources from December 2017', 'Articles with short description', 'Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from May 2012', 'Articles with unsourced statements from June 2018', 'CS1 Chinese-language sources (zh)', 'CS1 Korean-language sources (ko)', 'CS1 maint: BOT: original-url status unknown', 'CS1 uses Chinese-language script (zh)', 'CS1 uses Korean-language script (ko)', 'Coordinates on Wikidata', 'East Asian countries', 'G20 nations', 'Korea', 'Korean-speaking countries and territories', 'Member states of the United Nations', 'Northeast Asian countries', 'Official website different in Wikidata and Wikipedia', 'Pages using infobox country or infobox former country with the symbol caption or type parameters', 'Republics', 'South Korea', 'States and territories established in 1948', 'Use mdy dates from November 2017', 'Webarchive template wayback links', 'Webarchive template webcite links', 'Wikipedia articles incorporating text from the World Factbook', 'Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with MusicBrainz area identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with WorldCat-VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages']","['Romance', 'comedy']",MBC,"The drama is about love of singles in their 30s.

KBS series Drama City finished its run in 2008 after 14 years in Korea.

527,Gye Baek,"South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (ROK), is a country in East Asia, constituting the southern part of the Korean Peninsula and lying to the east of the Asian mainland. The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time, ruling most of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia, under Gwanggaeto the Great. South Korea lies in the north temperate zone and has a predominantly mountainous terrain. It comprises an estimated 51.4 million residents distributed over 100,363 km2 (38,750 sq mi). Its capital and largest city is Seoul, with a population of around 10 million.
Archaeology indicates that the Korean Peninsula was inhabited by early humans starting from the Lower Paleolithic period (2.6 Ma–300 Ka). The history of Korea begins with the foundation of Gojoseon in 2333 BCE by the mythic king Dangun, but no archaeological evidence and writing was found from this period. The Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in 11th century BCE, and its existence and role has been controversial in the modern era. The written historical record on Gojoseon (Old Joseon) was first mentioned in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under Unified Silla in CE 668, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910). It was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. At the end of World War II, Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S. zones of occupations. A separate election was held in the U.S. zone in 1948 which led to the creation of the Republic of Korea (ROK), while the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was established in the Soviet zone. The United Nations at the time passed a resolution declaring the ROK to be the only lawful government in Korea.The Korean War began in June 1950 when forces from North Korea invaded South Korea. The war lasted three years and involved the U.S., China, the Soviet Union and several other nations. The border between the two nations remains the most heavily fortified in the world. Under long-time military leader Park Chung-hee, the South Korean economy grew significantly and the country was transformed into a G-20 major economy. Military rule ended in 1987, and the country is now a presidential republic consisting of 17 administrative divisions.
South Korea is a highly developed country and a high-income economy, with a ""very high"" Human Development Index, ranking 22nd in the world. The country is considered a regional power and is the world's 11th largest economy by nominal GDP and the 12th largest by PPP as of 2010. South Korea is a global leader in the industrial and technological sectors, being the world's 5th largest exporter and 8th largest importer. Its export-driven economy primarily focuses production on electronics, automobiles, ships, machinery, petrochemicals and robotics. South Korea is a member of the ASEAN Plus mechanism, the United Nations, Uniting for Consensus, G20, the WTO and OECD and is a founding member of APEC and the East Asia Summit.","['1948 establishments in South Korea', 'All Wikipedia articles in need of updating', 'All articles containing potentially dated statements', 'All articles with dead external links', 'All articles with self-published sources', 'All articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Articles containing Korean-language text', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2005', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2010', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2016', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2018', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from May 2009', 'Articles with Curlie links', 'Articles with French-language external links', 'Articles with Korean-language external links', 'Articles with dead external links from April 2017', 'Articles with dead external links from February 2009', 'Articles with dead external links from July 2017', 'Articles with hAudio microformats', 'Articles with obsolete information from March 2012', 'Articles with permanently dead external links', 'Articles with self-published sources from December 2017', 'Articles with short description', 'Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from May 2012', 'Articles with unsourced statements from June 2018', 'CS1 Chinese-language sources (zh)', 'CS1 Korean-language sources (ko)', 'CS1 maint: BOT: original-url status unknown', 'CS1 uses Chinese-language script (zh)', 'CS1 uses Korean-language script (ko)', 'Coordinates on Wikidata', 'East Asian countries', 'G20 nations', 'Korea', 'Korean-speaking countries and territories', 'Member states of the United Nations', 'Northeast Asian countries', 'Official website different in Wikidata and Wikipedia', 'Pages using infobox country or infobox former country with the symbol caption or type parameters', 'Republics', 'South Korea', 'States and territories established in 1948', 'Use mdy dates from November 2017', 'Webarchive template wayback links', 'Webarchive template webcite links', 'Wikipedia articles incorporating text from the World Factbook', 'Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with MusicBrainz area identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with WorldCat-VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages']","['Historical', 'period']",MBC,A story about the life of General Gyebaek of Baekje in the mid 7th century.

554,The Servant,"Education in South Korea is provided by both public schools and private schools. Both types of schools receive funding from the government, although the amount that the private schools receive is less than the amount of the state schools. In recent years, Incheon Global Campus  (with start-up support) has kick-started, and Yonsei University opened an international college  to embrace the full English teaching environment scheme.
South Korea is one of the top-performing OECD countries in reading literacy, mathematics and sciences with the average student scoring 542. The country has one of the worlds highest-educated labour forces among OECD countries. The country is well known for its obsession with education, which has come to be called ""education fever"". The resource-poor nation is consistently ranked amongst the top for global education. In the 2014 national rankings of students’ math and science scores by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), South Korea ranked second place worldwide, after Singapore.Higher education is an overwhelmingly serious issue in South Korea society, where it is viewed as one of the fundamental cornerstones of South Korean life. Education is regarded with a high priority for South Korean families, as success in education is necessary for improving one's socioeconomic position in South Korean society. Academic success is often a source of pride for families and within South Korean society at large. South Koreans view education as the main propeller of social mobility for themselves and their family as a gateway to the South Korean middle class. Graduating from a top university is the ultimate marker of prestige, high socioeconomic status, promising marriage prospects, and a respectable career path. An average South Korean child's life revolves around education as pressure to succeed academically is deeply ingrained in South Korean children from an early age. Those who lack a formal university education often face social prejudice.In 2015, the country spent 4.7% of its GDP on all levels of education – roughly equal to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) average. A strong investment in education, a militant drive for success, as well as the passion for excellence has helped the resource poor country rapidly grow its economy over the past 60 years from a war-torn wasteland. South Korea’s zeal for education and its students’ desires to get into a prestigious university is one of the highest in the world, as the entrance into a top tier higher educational institution leads to a prestigious, secure and well-paid white collar job with the government, banks, a major South Korean conglomerate such as Samsung, Hyundai or LG Electronics. With incredible pressure on high school students to secure places at the nation’s best universities, its institutional reputation and alumni networks are strong predictors of future career prospects. The top three universities in South Korea, often referred to as ""SKY"", are Seoul National University, Korea University and Yonsei University. Intense competition and pressure to earn the highest grades is deeply ingrained in the psyche of South Korean students at a young age. Yet with only so many places at universities and even fewer places at top-tier companies, many young people remain disappointed and are often unwilling to lower their sights with the result of many feeling as underachievers. 
There is a major cultural taboo in South Korean society attached to those who have not achieved formal university education, where those who don't hold university degrees face social prejudice and are often looked down by others as second-class citizens, resulting fewer opportunities for employment, improvement of one's socioeconomic position and prospects for marriage.International reception on the South Korean education system has been divided. It has been praised for various reasons, including its comparatively high test results and its major role in ushering South Korea's economic development creating one of the world’s most educated workforces.
South Korea's highly enviable academic performance has gotten British education ministers actively remodeling their own curriculum's and exams to try to emulate Korea's militant drive and passion for excellence and high educational achievement. U.S. President Barack Obama has also praised the country's rigorous school system, where over 80 percent of South Korean high school graduates go on to university. The nation's high university entrance rate has created a highly skilled workforce making South Korea among the most highly educated countries in the world with the one of the highest percentage of its citizens holding a tertiary education degree. Bachelor's degrees are held by 68 percent of South Koreans aged 25–34, the most in the OECD.The system's rigid and hierarchical structure has been criticized for stifling creativity and innovation; described as intensely and ""brutally"" competitive, The system is often blamed for the high suicide rate in South Korea, particularly the growing rates among those aged 10–19. Various media outlets attribute the nations high suicide rate on the nationwide anxiety around the country's college entrance exams, which determine the trajectory of students' entire lives and careers.  Former South Korean hagwon teacher Se-Woong Koo wrote that the South Korean education system amounts to child abuse and that it should be ""reformed and restructured without delay."" The system has also been criticized for producing an excess supply of university graduates creating an overeducated and underemployed labor force; in the first quarter of 2013 alone, nearly 3.3 million South Korean university graduates were jobless, leading many graduates overqualified for jobs requiring less education.

557,Just You,"South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (ROK), is a country in East Asia, constituting the southern part of the Korean Peninsula and lying to the east of the Asian mainland. The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time, ruling most of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia, under Gwanggaeto the Great. South Korea lies in the north temperate zone and has a predominantly mountainous terrain. It comprises an estimated 51.4 million residents distributed over 100,363 km2 (38,750 sq mi). Its capital and largest city is Seoul, with a population of around 10 million.
Archaeology indicates that the Korean Peninsula was inhabited by early humans starting from the Lower Paleolithic period (2.6 Ma–300 Ka). The history of Korea begins with the foundation of Gojoseon in 2333 BCE by the mythic king Dangun, but no archaeological evidence and writing was found from this period. The Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in 11th century BCE, and its existence and role has been controversial in the modern era. The written historical record on Gojoseon (Old Joseon) was first mentioned in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under Unified Silla in CE 668, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910). It was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. At the end of World War II, Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S. zones of occupations. A separate election was held in the U.S. zone in 1948 which led to the creation of the Republic of Korea (ROK), while the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was established in the Soviet zone. The United Nations at the time passed a resolution declaring the ROK to be the only lawful government in Korea.The Korean War began in June 1950 when forces from North Korea invaded South Korea. The war lasted three years and involved the U.S., China, the Soviet Union and several other nations. The border between the two nations remains the most heavily fortified in the world. Under long-time military leader Park Chung-hee, the South Korean economy grew significantly and the country was transformed into a G-20 major economy. Military rule ended in 1987, and the country is now a presidential republic consisting of 17 administrative divisions.
South Korea is a highly developed country and a high-income economy, with a ""very high"" Human Development Index, ranking 22nd in the world. The country is considered a regional power and is the world's 11th largest economy by nominal GDP and the 12th largest by PPP as of 2010. South Korea is a global leader in the industrial and technological sectors, being the world's 5th largest exporter and 8th largest importer. Its export-driven economy primarily focuses production on electronics, automobiles, ships, machinery, petrochemicals and robotics. South Korea is a member of the ASEAN Plus mechanism, the United Nations, Uniting for Consensus, G20, the WTO and OECD and is a founding member of APEC and the East Asia Summit.","['1948 establishments in South Korea', 'All Wikipedia articles in need of updating', 'All articles containing potentially dated statements', 'All articles with dead external links', 'All articles with self-published sources', 'All articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Articles containing Korean-language text', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2005', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2010', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2016', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2018', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from May 2009', 'Articles with Curlie links', 'Articles with French-language external links', 'Articles with Korean-language external links', 'Articles with dead external links from April 2017', 'Articles with dead external links from February 2009', 'Articles with dead external links from July 2017', 'Articles with hAudio microformats', 'Articles with obsolete information from March 2012', 'Articles with permanently dead external links', 'Articles with self-published sources from December 2017', 'Articles with short description', 'Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from May 2012', 'Articles with unsourced statements from June 2018', 'CS1 Chinese-language sources (zh)', 'CS1 Korean-language sources (ko)', 'CS1 maint: BOT: original-url status unknown', 'CS1 uses Chinese-language script (zh)', 'CS1 uses Korean-language script (ko)', 'Coordinates on Wikidata', 'East Asian countries', 'G20 nations', 'Korea', 'Korean-speaking countries and territories', 'Member states of the United Nations', 'Northeast Asian countries', 'Official website different in Wikidata and Wikipedia', 'Pages using infobox country or infobox former country with the symbol caption or type parameters', 'Republics', 'South Korea', 'States and territories established in 1948', 'Use mdy dates from November 2017', 'Webarchive template wayback links', 'Webarchive template webcite links', 'Wikipedia articles incorporating text from the World Factbook', 'Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with MusicBrainz area identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with WorldCat-VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages']","['Family', 'Romance']",,"A drama that draws the love of Ki Woon Chan, a high school-graduate struggling to find a job and Na Moo Goong Hwa, the only daughter of an amazingly rich family and the conflicts and reconciliation of their families."

584,The Sons,"South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (ROK), is a country in East Asia, constituting the southern part of the Korean Peninsula and lying to the east of the Asian mainland. The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time, ruling most of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia, under Gwanggaeto the Great. South Korea lies in the north temperate zone and has a predominantly mountainous terrain. It comprises an estimated 51.4 million residents distributed over 100,363 km2 (38,750 sq mi). Its capital and largest city is Seoul, with a population of around 10 million.
Archaeology indicates that the Korean Peninsula was inhabited by early humans starting from the Lower Paleolithic period (2.6 Ma–300 Ka). The history of Korea begins with the foundation of Gojoseon in 2333 BCE by the mythic king Dangun, but no archaeological evidence and writing was found from this period. The Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in 11th century BCE, and its existence and role has been controversial in the modern era. The written historical record on Gojoseon (Old Joseon) was first mentioned in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under Unified Silla in CE 668, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910). It was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. At the end of World War II, Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S. zones of occupations. A separate election was held in the U.S. zone in 1948 which led to the creation of the Republic of Korea (ROK), while the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was established in the Soviet zone. The United Nations at the time passed a resolution declaring the ROK to be the only lawful government in Korea.The Korean War began in June 1950 when forces from North Korea invaded South Korea. The war lasted three years and involved the U.S., China, the Soviet Union and several other nations. The border between the two nations remains the most heavily fortified in the world. Under long-time military leader Park Chung-hee, the South Korean economy grew significantly and the country was transformed into a G-20 major economy. Military rule ended in 1987, and the country is now a presidential republic consisting of 17 administrative divisions.
South Korea is a highly developed country and a high-income economy, with a ""very high"" Human Development Index, ranking 22nd in the world. The country is considered a regional power and is the world's 11th largest economy by nominal GDP and the 12th largest by PPP as of 2010. South Korea is a global leader in the industrial and technological sectors, being the world's 5th largest exporter and 8th largest importer. Its export-driven economy primarily focuses production on electronics, automobiles, ships, machinery, petrochemicals and robotics. South Korea is a member of the ASEAN Plus mechanism, the United Nations, Uniting for Consensus, G20, the WTO and OECD and is a founding member of APEC and the East Asia Summit.","['1948 establishments in South Korea', 'All Wikipedia articles in need of updating', 'All articles containing potentially dated statements', 'All articles with dead external links', 'All articles with self-published sources', 'All articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Articles containing Korean-language text', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2005', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2010', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2016', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2018', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from May 2009', 'Articles with Curlie links', 'Articles with French-language external links', 'Articles with Korean-language external links', 'Articles with dead external links from April 2017', 'Articles with dead external links from February 2009', 'Articles with dead external links from July 2017', 'Articles with hAudio microformats', 'Articles with obsolete information from March 2012', 'Articles with permanently dead external links', 'Articles with self-published sources from December 2017', 'Articles with short description', 'Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from May 2012', 'Articles with unsourced statements from June 2018', 'CS1 Chinese-language sources (zh)', 'CS1 Korean-language sources (ko)', 'CS1 maint: BOT: original-url status unknown', 'CS1 uses Chinese-language script (zh)', 'CS1 uses Korean-language script (ko)', 'Coordinates on Wikidata', 'East Asian countries', 'G20 nations', 'Korea', 'Korean-speaking countries and territories', 'Member states of the United Nations', 'Northeast Asian countries', 'Official website different in Wikidata and Wikipedia', 'Pages using infobox country or infobox former country with the symbol caption or type parameters', 'Republics', 'South Korea', 'States and territories established in 1948', 'Use mdy dates from November 2017', 'Webarchive template wayback links', 'Webarchive template webcite links', 'Wikipedia articles incorporating text from the World Factbook', 'Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with MusicBrainz area identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with WorldCat-VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages']","['Family', 'Romance', 'Comedy']",MBC,"A family drama tell the story of three different characteristics of sons and deals with marriage and divorce in the means of trying to find the justice of love.</p><p>First Son, Yoo Hyun ki (<a href=""http://star.koreandrama.org/?p=1077"" target=""_blank"">Lee Sung Jae</a>), a widower and single dad with a daughter.

All his descendants are members of the Yi clan of Jeonju, including the imperial family of the Korean Empire (1897–1910).
After the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1910, in which the Empire of Japan annexed the Korean Peninsula, some members of the Yi clan of Jeonju were mediatised into the Imperial House of Japan and the Japanese peerage by the Japanese government until 1947, just before the Constitution of Japan was promulgated. Under the 11th Article of the Constitution of South Korea, the Korean government does not acknowledge any form of privileged caste since its promulgation in 1948. Nevertheless, they continue to attract occasional media attention in South Korea. This happened most recently with the July 2005 funeral of Yi Gu, former head of the royal household.
Since the death of Yi Gu, Prince Imperial Hoeun in 2005, the succession of the title for the head of the Yi clan has been disputed. The Imperial Grandsons Association, which is run by members of the family and the city of Jeonju, home of the Yi Dynasty, considers Prince Yi Seok as the head of the family.  Another organization formed by Yi Won in 2012, (대한황실문화원, 大韓皇室文化院) put forth Yi Won as the head of the house. Finally, Yi Hae-won, second daughter of the Prince Yi Kang, made a counter-claim as the ""Empress of Korea"" in a private ceremony organized by her followers in a hotel room.

604,Iron Man,"The Man in the Iron Mask (French: L'Homme au Masque de Fer; c. 1640 – 19 November 1703) is the name given to an unidentified prisoner who was arrested in 1669 or 1670 and subsequently held in a number of French prisons, including the Bastille and the Fortress of Pignerol (modern Pinerolo, Italy). He was held in the custody of the same jailer, Bénigne Dauvergne de Saint-Mars, for a period of 34 years. He died on 19 November 1703 under the name ""Marchioly"", during the reign of King Louis XIV of France (1643–1715). 
Since no one ever saw his face because it was hidden by a mask of black velvet cloth, the true identity of the prisoner remains a mystery; it has been extensively debated by historians, and various theories have been expounded in numerous books and films.
Among the leading theories are those proposed by writer and philosopher Voltaire: he claimed in the second edition of his Questions sur l'Encyclopédie (1771) that the prisoner wore a mask made of iron rather than of cloth, and that he was the older, illegitimate brother of Louis XIV. What little is known about the historical Man in the Iron Mask is based mainly on correspondence between Saint-Mars and his superiors in Paris. Recent research suggests that his name might have been ""Eustache Dauger"", a man who was involved in several political scandals of the late 17th century, but this assertion still has not been completely proven.
The National Archives of France has made available (online) the original data relating to the inventories of the goods and papers of Saint-Mars (one inventory, of 64 pages, was drawn up at the Bastille in 1708; the other, of 68 pages, at the citadel of Sainte-Marguerite in 1691). These documents have been sought in vain for more than a century and were thought to have been lost. They were discovered in 2015, among the 100 million documents of the Minutier central des notaires de Paris. They show that some of the 800 documents in the possession of the jailer Saint-Mars were analysed after his death. These documents confirm the reputed avarice of Saint-Mars, who appears to have diverted the funds paid by the king for the prisoner. They also give a description of a cell occupied by the masked prisoner, which contained only a sleeping mat, but no luxuries, as was previously thought. 
With the scientific support of the National Library of France collections of ancient textiles, the accuracy of these notary documents discovered in 2015 has allowed the creation of the first virtual reconstruction of the prison of the man in the iron mask.The Man in the Iron Mask has also appeared in many works of fiction, most prominently in the late 1840s by Alexandre Dumas. A section of his novel The Vicomte of Bragelonne: Ten Years Later, the final installment of his D'Artagnan saga, features the Man in the Iron Mask. Here the prisoner is forced to wear an iron mask and is portrayed as Louis XIV's identical twin. Dumas also presented a review of the popular theories about the prisoner extant in his time in the chapter ""L'homme au masque de fer"" in the sixth volume of his non-fiction Crimes Célèbres.","['1703 deaths', '17th-century French people', '17th-century births', '18th-century French people', 'All articles needing additional references', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Articles containing French-language text', 'Articles needing additional references from October 2016', 'Articles with Project Gutenberg links', 'Articles with hCards', 'Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from July 2010', 'Articles with unsourced statements from August 2010', 'Articles with unsourced statements from August 2018', 'Articles with unsourced statements from November 2017', 'CS1 French-language sources (fr)', 'French folklore', 'Interlanguage link template link number', 'Man in the Iron Mask', 'Masked people by occupation', 'Mysteries', 'Pages using infobox criminal with known for parameter', 'People of the Ancien Régime', 'Prisoners and detainees of France', 'Unidentified people', 'Use dmy dates from July 2016', 'Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with WorldCat-VIAF identifiers']","['Action', 'Romance', 'Melodrama']",KBS2,"A love story about a man who has knives standing upright all over his body because of the pain that his heart’s been through and a woman who helps him grow and become a real human with her true love.</p><p>Joo Hong Bin (<a href=""http://star.koreandrama.org/?p=79"" target=""_blank"">Lee Dong Wook</a>) is a heartless and fearless man.

609,Island Village Teacher,"South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (ROK), is a country in East Asia, constituting the southern part of the Korean Peninsula and lying to the east of the Asian mainland. The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time, ruling most of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia, under Gwanggaeto the Great. South Korea lies in the north temperate zone and has a predominantly mountainous terrain. It comprises an estimated 51.4 million residents distributed over 100,363 km2 (38,750 sq mi). Its capital and largest city is Seoul, with a population of around 10 million.
Archaeology indicates that the Korean Peninsula was inhabited by early humans starting from the Lower Paleolithic period (2.6 Ma–300 Ka). The history of Korea begins with the foundation of Gojoseon in 2333 BCE by the mythic king Dangun, but no archaeological evidence and writing was found from this period. The Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in 11th century BCE, and its existence and role has been controversial in the modern era. The written historical record on Gojoseon (Old Joseon) was first mentioned in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under Unified Silla in CE 668, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910). It was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. At the end of World War II, Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S. zones of occupations. A separate election was held in the U.S. zone in 1948 which led to the creation of the Republic of Korea (ROK), while the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was established in the Soviet zone. The United Nations at the time passed a resolution declaring the ROK to be the only lawful government in Korea.The Korean War began in June 1950 when forces from North Korea invaded South Korea. The war lasted three years and involved the U.S., China, the Soviet Union and several other nations. The border between the two nations remains the most heavily fortified in the world. Under long-time military leader Park Chung-hee, the South Korean economy grew significantly and the country was transformed into a G-20 major economy. Military rule ended in 1987, and the country is now a presidential republic consisting of 17 administrative divisions.
South Korea is a highly developed country and a high-income economy, with a ""very high"" Human Development Index, ranking 22nd in the world. The country is considered a regional power and is the world's 11th largest economy by nominal GDP and the 12th largest by PPP as of 2010. South Korea is a global leader in the industrial and technological sectors, being the world's 5th largest exporter and 8th largest importer. Its export-driven economy primarily focuses production on electronics, automobiles, ships, machinery, petrochemicals and robotics. South Korea is a member of the ASEAN Plus mechanism, the United Nations, Uniting for Consensus, G20, the WTO and OECD and is a founding member of APEC and the East Asia Summit.","['1948 establishments in South Korea', 'All Wikipedia articles in need of updating', 'All articles containing potentially dated statements', 'All articles with dead external links', 'All articles with self-published sources', 'All articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Articles containing Korean-language text', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2005', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2010', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2016', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2018', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from May 2009', 'Articles with Curlie links', 'Articles with French-language external links', 'Articles with Korean-language external links', 'Articles with dead external links from April 2017', 'Articles with dead external links from February 2009', 'Articles with dead external links from July 2017', 'Articles with hAudio microformats', 'Articles with obsolete information from March 2012', 'Articles with permanently dead external links', 'Articles with self-published sources from December 2017', 'Articles with short description', 'Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from May 2012', 'Articles with unsourced statements from June 2018', 'CS1 Chinese-language sources (zh)', 'CS1 Korean-language sources (ko)', 'CS1 maint: BOT: original-url status unknown', 'CS1 uses Chinese-language script (zh)', 'CS1 uses Korean-language script (ko)', 'Coordinates on Wikidata', 'East Asian countries', 'G20 nations', 'Korea', 'Korean-speaking countries and territories', 'Member states of the United Nations', 'Northeast Asian countries', 'Official website different in Wikidata and Wikipedia', 'Pages using infobox country or infobox former country with the symbol caption or type parameters', 'Republics', 'South Korea', 'States and territories established in 1948', 'Use mdy dates from November 2017', 'Webarchive template wayback links', 'Webarchive template webcite links', 'Wikipedia articles incorporating text from the World Factbook', 'Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with MusicBrainz area identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with WorldCat-VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages']","['Romance', 'Comedy', 'CrimeInvestigation']",SBS,"Hong Eun Xiu (Han Ji Hye) accidentally witnessed a murder by a ruthless gangster and was placed under the protection of the police.

645,Her Style,"South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (ROK), is a country in East Asia, constituting the southern part of the Korean Peninsula and lying to the east of the Asian mainland. The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time, ruling most of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia, under Gwanggaeto the Great. South Korea lies in the north temperate zone and has a predominantly mountainous terrain. It comprises an estimated 51.4 million residents distributed over 100,363 km2 (38,750 sq mi). Its capital and largest city is Seoul, with a population of around 10 million.
Archaeology indicates that the Korean Peninsula was inhabited by early humans starting from the Lower Paleolithic period (2.6 Ma–300 Ka). The history of Korea begins with the foundation of Gojoseon in 2333 BCE by the mythic king Dangun, but no archaeological evidence and writing was found from this period. The Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in 11th century BCE, and its existence and role has been controversial in the modern era. The written historical record on Gojoseon (Old Joseon) was first mentioned in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under Unified Silla in CE 668, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910). It was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. At the end of World War II, Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S. zones of occupations. A separate election was held in the U.S. zone in 1948 which led to the creation of the Republic of Korea (ROK), while the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was established in the Soviet zone. The United Nations at the time passed a resolution declaring the ROK to be the only lawful government in Korea.The Korean War began in June 1950 when forces from North Korea invaded South Korea. The war lasted three years and involved the U.S., China, the Soviet Union and several other nations. The border between the two nations remains the most heavily fortified in the world. Under long-time military leader Park Chung-hee, the South Korean economy grew significantly and the country was transformed into a G-20 major economy.

654,Snow Lotus,"Saussurea is a genus of about 300 species of flowering plants in the thistle tribe within the daisy family, native to cool temperate and arctic regions of Asia, Europe, and North America, with the highest diversity in alpine habitats in the Himalaya and central Asia. Common names include saw-wort and snow lotus, the latter used for a number of high altitude species in central Asia.
They are perennial herbaceous plants, ranging in height from dwarf alpine species 5–10 cm tall, to tall thistle-like plants up to 3 m tall. The leaves are produced in a dense basal rosette, and then spirally up the flowering stem. The flowers form in a dense head of small capitula, often surrounded by dense white to purple woolly hairs; the individual florets are also white to purple. The wool is densest in the high altitude species, and aid in thermoregulation of the flowers, minimising frost damage at night, and also preventing ultraviolet light damage from the intense high altitude sunlight.

668,Still You,"South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (ROK), is a country in East Asia, constituting the southern part of the Korean Peninsula and lying to the east of the Asian mainland. The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time, ruling most of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia, under Gwanggaeto the Great. South Korea lies in the north temperate zone and has a predominantly mountainous terrain. It comprises an estimated 51.4 million residents distributed over 100,363 km2 (38,750 sq mi). Its capital and largest city is Seoul, with a population of around 10 million.
Archaeology indicates that the Korean Peninsula was inhabited by early humans starting from the Lower Paleolithic period (2.6 Ma–300 Ka). The history of Korea begins with the foundation of Gojoseon in 2333 BCE by the mythic king Dangun, but no archaeological evidence and writing was found from this period. The Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in 11th century BCE, and its existence and role has been controversial in the modern era. The written historical record on Gojoseon (Old Joseon) was first mentioned in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under Unified Silla in CE 668, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910). It was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. At the end of World War II, Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S. zones of occupations. A separate election was held in the U.S. zone in 1948 which led to the creation of the Republic of Korea (ROK), while the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was established in the Soviet zone. The United Nations at the time passed a resolution declaring the ROK to be the only lawful government in Korea.The Korean War began in June 1950 when forces from North Korea invaded South Korea. The war lasted three years and involved the U.S., China, the Soviet Union and several other nations. The border between the two nations remains the most heavily fortified in the world. Under long-time military leader Park Chung-hee, the South Korean economy grew significantly and the country was transformed into a G-20 major economy. Military rule ended in 1987, and the country is now a presidential republic consisting of 17 administrative divisions.
South Korea is a highly developed country and a high-income economy, with a ""very high"" Human Development Index, ranking 22nd in the world. The country is considered a regional power and is the world's 11th largest economy by nominal GDP and the 12th largest by PPP as of 2010. South Korea is a global leader in the industrial and technological sectors, being the world's 5th largest exporter and 8th largest importer. Its export-driven economy primarily focuses production on electronics, automobiles, ships, machinery, petrochemicals and robotics. South Korea is a member of the ASEAN Plus mechanism, the United Nations, Uniting for Consensus, G20, the WTO and OECD and is a founding member of APEC and the East Asia Summit.","['1948 establishments in South Korea', 'All Wikipedia articles in need of updating', 'All articles containing potentially dated statements', 'All articles with dead external links', 'All articles with self-published sources', 'All articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Articles containing Korean-language text', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2005', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2010', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2016', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2018', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from May 2009', 'Articles with Curlie links', 'Articles with French-language external links', 'Articles with Korean-language external links', 'Articles with dead external links from April 2017', 'Articles with dead external links from February 2009', 'Articles with dead external links from July 2017', 'Articles with hAudio microformats', 'Articles with obsolete information from March 2012', 'Articles with permanently dead external links', 'Articles with self-published sources from December 2017', 'Articles with short description', 'Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from May 2012', 'Articles with unsourced statements from June 2018', 'CS1 Chinese-language sources (zh)', 'CS1 Korean-language sources (ko)', 'CS1 maint: BOT: original-url status unknown', 'CS1 uses Chinese-language script (zh)', 'CS1 uses Korean-language script (ko)', 'Coordinates on Wikidata', 'East Asian countries', 'G20 nations', 'Korea', 'Korean-speaking countries and territories', 'Member states of the United Nations', 'Northeast Asian countries', 'Official website different in Wikidata and Wikipedia', 'Pages using infobox country or infobox former country with the symbol caption or type parameters', 'Republics', 'South Korea', 'States and territories established in 1948', 'Use mdy dates from November 2017', 'Webarchive template wayback links', 'Webarchive template webcite links', 'Wikipedia articles incorporating text from the World Factbook', 'Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with MusicBrainz area identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with WorldCat-VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages']","['Romance', 'Melodrama', 'Family']",SBS,"A drama about a woman, Cha Soon Young (<a href=""http://star.koreandrama.org/?p=740"" target=""_blank"">Shin Eun Gyung</a>) who just want to make a fake divorce with her husband but turn out with the real divorce."

The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time, ruling most of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia, under Gwanggaeto the Great. South Korea lies in the north temperate zone and has a predominantly mountainous terrain. It comprises an estimated 51.4 million residents distributed over 100,363 km2 (38,750 sq mi). Its capital and largest city is Seoul, with a population of around 10 million.
Archaeology indicates that the Korean Peninsula was inhabited by early humans starting from the Lower Paleolithic period (2.6 Ma–300 Ka). The history of Korea begins with the foundation of Gojoseon in 2333 BCE by the mythic king Dangun, but no archaeological evidence and writing was found from this period. The Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in 11th century BCE, and its existence and role has been controversial in the modern era. The written historical record on Gojoseon (Old Joseon) was first mentioned in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under Unified Silla in CE 668, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910). It was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. At the end of World War II, Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S. zones of occupations. A separate election was held in the U.S. zone in 1948 which led to the creation of the Republic of Korea (ROK), while the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was established in the Soviet zone. The United Nations at the time passed a resolution declaring the ROK to be the only lawful government in Korea.The Korean War began in June 1950 when forces from North Korea invaded South Korea. The war lasted three years and involved the U.S., China, the Soviet Union and several other nations. The border between the two nations remains the most heavily fortified in the world. Under long-time military leader Park Chung-hee, the South Korean economy grew significantly and the country was transformed into a G-20 major economy.

698,Blue Fish,"South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (ROK), is a country in East Asia, constituting the southern part of the Korean Peninsula and lying to the east of the Asian mainland. The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time, ruling most of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia, under Gwanggaeto the Great. South Korea lies in the north temperate zone and has a predominantly mountainous terrain. It comprises an estimated 51.4 million residents distributed over 100,363 km2 (38,750 sq mi). Its capital and largest city is Seoul, with a population of around 10 million.
Archaeology indicates that the Korean Peninsula was inhabited by early humans starting from the Lower Paleolithic period (2.6 Ma–300 Ka). The history of Korea begins with the foundation of Gojoseon in 2333 BCE by the mythic king Dangun, but no archaeological evidence and writing was found from this period. The Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in 11th century BCE, and its existence and role has been controversial in the modern era. The written historical record on Gojoseon (Old Joseon) was first mentioned in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under Unified Silla in CE 668, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910). It was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. At the end of World War II, Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S. zones of occupations. A separate election was held in the U.S. zone in 1948 which led to the creation of the Republic of Korea (ROK), while the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was established in the Soviet zone. The United Nations at the time passed a resolution declaring the ROK to be the only lawful government in Korea.The Korean War began in June 1950 when forces from North Korea invaded South Korea. The war lasted three years and involved the U.S., China, the Soviet Union and several other nations. The border between the two nations remains the most heavily fortified in the world. Under long-time military leader Park Chung-hee, the South Korean economy grew significantly and the country was transformed into a G-20 major economy. Military rule ended in 1987, and the country is now a presidential republic consisting of 17 administrative divisions.
South Korea is a highly developed country and a high-income economy, with a ""very high"" Human Development Index, ranking 22nd in the world. The country is considered a regional power and is the world's 11th largest economy by nominal GDP and the 12th largest by PPP as of 2010. South Korea is a global leader in the industrial and technological sectors, being the world's 5th largest exporter and 8th largest importer. Its export-driven economy primarily focuses production on electronics, automobiles, ships, machinery, petrochemicals and robotics. South Korea is a member of the ASEAN Plus mechanism, the United Nations, Uniting for Consensus, G20, the WTO and OECD and is a founding member of APEC and the East Asia Summit.","['1948 establishments in South Korea', 'All Wikipedia articles in need of updating', 'All articles containing potentially dated statements', 'All articles with dead external links', 'All articles with self-published sources', 'All articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Articles containing Korean-language text', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2005', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2010', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2016', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2018', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from May 2009', 'Articles with Curlie links', 'Articles with French-language external links', 'Articles with Korean-language external links', 'Articles with dead external links from April 2017', 'Articles with dead external links from February 2009', 'Articles with dead external links from July 2017', 'Articles with hAudio microformats', 'Articles with obsolete information from March 2012', 'Articles with permanently dead external links', 'Articles with self-published sources from December 2017', 'Articles with short description', 'Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from May 2012', 'Articles with unsourced statements from June 2018', 'CS1 Chinese-language sources (zh)', 'CS1 Korean-language sources (ko)', 'CS1 maint: BOT: original-url status unknown', 'CS1 uses Chinese-language script (zh)', 'CS1 uses Korean-language script (ko)', 'Coordinates on Wikidata', 'East Asian countries', 'G20 nations', 'Korea', 'Korean-speaking countries and territories', 'Member states of the United Nations', 'Northeast Asian countries', 'Official website different in Wikidata and Wikipedia', 'Pages using infobox country or infobox former country with the symbol caption or type parameters', 'Republics', 'South Korea', 'States and territories established in 1948', 'Use mdy dates from November 2017', 'Webarchive template wayback links', 'Webarchive template webcite links', 'Wikipedia articles incorporating text from the World Factbook', 'Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with MusicBrainz area identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with WorldCat-VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages']",['Romance'],SBS,"This is a drama about a violinist, Jung Eun Soo, and a car designer, Lee Hyun Woo.

They are often cited as one of the most influential acts to shape the K-pop industry by helping spread the Korean Wave internationally and dubbed as  the ""Kings of K-pop"" by the media. Their experimental and diverse use of music genres, personal involvement in producing their own records, and stage performances have been admired by music critics and served as influence to numerous K-pop and international artists.Despite their debut album, Bigbang Vol.1 (2006), receiving lukewarm reception, success followed with a string of notable hits credited to the quintet, including ""Lies"" (Korean: 거짓말), which topped major Korean music charts for a record-breaking six consecutive weeks and won Song of the Year at the 2007 Mnet Km Music Festival and the 2008 Seoul Music Awards; ""Last Farewell"" (Korean: 마지막 인사); ""Day by Day"" (Korean: 하루하루); and ""Sunset Glow"" (Korean: 붉은노을). After receiving the Artist of the Year award from the 2008 Mnet Korean Music Festival and the 2008 Seoul Music Awards, the group expanded their endeavors to Japan, releasing four studio albums, Big Bang (2009), Big Bang 2 (2011), Alive (2012), and Made Series (2016), which are all certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of Japan.
After a two-year hiatus in South Korea, the quintet produced increasingly innovative and critically acclaimed recordings. Their fourth EP, Tonight (2011), lead to their emergence as the inaugural Best Worldwide Act winner at the 2011 MTV Europe Music Awards. Their fifth EP, Alive (2012), became the first Korean album to chart on the Billboard 200. Their widely acclaimed third album, Made (2016), was preceded by several chart-topping singles, winning the group their third Artist of the Year award at the 2015 Mnet Asian Music Awards and their first at the 2015 Melon Music Awards. The supporting world tour gathered 1.5 million people in attendance, making it the most attended concert tour headlined by a Korean act in history.Big Bang has a record of 18 number-one songs that have collectively remained atop South Korean's biggest online music service Melon for 51 weeks, more than any other act. The quintet have sold over 140 million records and counting, making them one of the biggest-selling boy-bands in the world beating out American favorites like the Backstreet Boys and the Jackson Five. Forbes Korea ranked them as one of the most powerful celebrities in South Korea in 2010, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2016. They were also the first Korean artists to enter Forbes' Celebrity 100 and the 30 under 30 list of most influential musicians in the world, in 2016 and 2017, respectively.","['All articles with peacock terms', 'Articles containing Japanese-language text', 'Articles containing Korean-language text', 'Articles with Korean-language external links', 'Articles with hAudio microformats', 'Articles with hCards', 'Articles with peacock terms from April 2019', 'Articles with short description', 'Avex Group artists', 'Big Bang (South Korean band)', 'CS1 Chinese-language sources (zh)', 'CS1 Greek-language sources (el)', 'CS1 Japanese-language sources (ja)', 'CS1 Korean-language sources (ko)', 'CS1 Spanish-language sources (es)', 'CS1 Vietnamese-language sources (vi)', 'CS1 maint: BOT: original-url status unknown', 'CS1 uses Korean-language script (ko)', 'Commons category link is on Wikidata', 'Good articles', 'Grand Prize Golden Disc Award recipients', 'K-pop music groups', 'Korean Music Award winners', 'Melon Music Award winners', 'Mnet Asian Music Award winners', 'Musical groups established in 2006', 'Musical groups from Seoul', 'Musical quintets', 'Pages containing links to subscription-only content', 'South Korean boy bands', 'South Korean contemporary R&B musical groups', 'South Korean dance music groups', 'South Korean electronic musicians', 'South Korean hip hop groups', 'South Korean pop music groups', 'Universal Music Japan artists', 'Webarchive template wayback links', 'Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with MusicBrainz identifiers', 'Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages', 'YG Entertainment artists']","['Melodrama', 'Revenge', 'Romance']",KBS2,"Kim Ji Hyuk (<a href=""http://star.koreandrama.org/?p=550"" target=""_blank"">Kang Ji Hwan</a>) doesn’t have parents and goes through a tough life.

720,White Lies,"South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (ROK), is a country in East Asia, constituting the southern part of the Korean Peninsula and lying to the east of the Asian mainland. The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time, ruling most of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia, under Gwanggaeto the Great. South Korea lies in the north temperate zone and has a predominantly mountainous terrain. It comprises an estimated 51.4 million residents distributed over 100,363 km2 (38,750 sq mi). Its capital and largest city is Seoul, with a population of around 10 million.
Archaeology indicates that the Korean Peninsula was inhabited by early humans starting from the Lower Paleolithic period (2.6 Ma–300 Ka). The history of Korea begins with the foundation of Gojoseon in 2333 BCE by the mythic king Dangun, but no archaeological evidence and writing was found from this period. The Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in 11th century BCE, and its existence and role has been controversial in the modern era. The written historical record on Gojoseon (Old Joseon) was first mentioned in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under Unified Silla in CE 668, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910). It was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. At the end of World War II, Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S. zones of occupations. A separate election was held in the U.S. zone in 1948 which led to the creation of the Republic of Korea (ROK), while the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was established in the Soviet zone. The United Nations at the time passed a resolution declaring the ROK to be the only lawful government in Korea.The Korean War began in June 1950 when forces from North Korea invaded South Korea. The war lasted three years and involved the U.S., China, the Soviet Union and several other nations. The border between the two nations remains the most heavily fortified in the world. Under long-time military leader Park Chung-hee, the South Korean economy grew significantly and the country was transformed into a G-20 major economy.

723,The King’s Face,"South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (ROK), is a country in East Asia, constituting the southern part of the Korean Peninsula and lying to the east of the Asian mainland. The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time, ruling most of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia, under Gwanggaeto the Great. South Korea lies in the north temperate zone and has a predominantly mountainous terrain. It comprises an estimated 51.4 million residents distributed over 100,363 km2 (38,750 sq mi). Its capital and largest city is Seoul, with a population of around 10 million.
Archaeology indicates that the Korean Peninsula was inhabited by early humans starting from the Lower Paleolithic period (2.6 Ma–300 Ka). The history of Korea begins with the foundation of Gojoseon in 2333 BCE by the mythic king Dangun, but no archaeological evidence and writing was found from this period. The Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in 11th century BCE, and its existence and role has been controversial in the modern era. The written historical record on Gojoseon (Old Joseon) was first mentioned in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under Unified Silla in CE 668, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910). It was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. At the end of World War II, Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S. zones of occupations. A separate election was held in the U.S. zone in 1948 which led to the creation of the Republic of Korea (ROK), while the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was established in the Soviet zone. The United Nations at the time passed a resolution declaring the ROK to be the only lawful government in Korea.The Korean War began in June 1950 when forces from North Korea invaded South Korea. The war lasted three years and involved the U.S., China, the Soviet Union and several other nations. The border between the two nations remains the most heavily fortified in the world.

727,Secret,"Secret (Hangul: 시크릿) was a South Korean K-pop girl group formed by TS Entertainment in 2009. The group originally debuted with four members: Jun Hyoseong, Jung Hana, Song Jieun and Han Sunhwa. They released their debut single I Want You Back October 2009.

In 2010, Secret released two singles Magic and Madonna which earned much attention with both singles peaking at No. 2 and No. 1 respectively on the Gaon Digital Chart. With the success of ""Magic"" and ""Madonna"", the group received the ""Newcomer Award"" at the 25th Golden Disk Awards. During Secret's early days the group was known as ""basement idols"" because of the poor living conditions they were in, but with their rapid success the group was able to move into better conditions.In 2011, Secret adopted a girl-next-door image through songs like Shy Boy and Starlight Moonlight which led the group to major success. With the hit single Shy Boy Secret won their first music show award on M Countdown; they also managed to stay at number one on Music Bank for three consecutive weeks, earning them a triple crown. Shy Boy and Starlight Moonlight won Secret multiple awards including two Song of the Year awards at the 1st Gaon Chart Awards for the months of January and June. Secret released their first full-length album Moving in Secret in October 2011, featuring the lead single ""Love is Move"" which showcased Secret's sexy and confident side again. With the group's success in South Korea throughout 2011, Secret sold over seven million in digital download sales.
In August of the same year, Secret made their Japanese debut releasing their first single, ""Madonna"", a remake of their Korean hit single, which debuted at number nine on the Oricon charts. In November 2011, ""Shy Boy"" was remade to serve as the lead single on their first Japanese mini album Shy Boy which also featured a Christmas remake of ""Starlight Moonlight"" titled ""Christmas Magic"". Throughout 2012, Secret heavily promoted in Japan releasing two Japanese singles, So Much For Goodbye and Twinkle Twinkle, prior to releasing their first full-length Japanese album, Welcome to Secret Time. Twinkle Twinkle was used as the ending theme song of the Naruto spin-off, ""Naruto SD: Rock Lee and his Ninja Pals"" which aired on TV Tokyo.

742,Giant,"India–South Korea relations have been relatively strong for 2,000 years, although more progress arose during the past three decades. Korea and India share a lot of similarities in every aspect. Since the formal establishment of the diplomatic ties between the two countries in 1973, several trade agreements have been reached: Agreement on Trade Promotion and Economic and Technological Co-operation at 1974; Agreement on Co-operation in Science & Technology in 1976; Convention on Double Taxation Avoidance in 1985; and Bilateral Investment Promotion/ Protection Agreement in 1996. Trade between the two nations has increased exponentially, exemplified by the $530 million during the fiscal year of 1992-1993, and the US$10 billion during 2006-2007. It further increased to US$17.6 billion in the year 2013.
During the 1997 Asian financial crisis, South Korean businesses sought to increase access to the global markets, and began trade investments with India. The last two presidential visits from South Korea to India were in 2006 and 2018,and the embassy works between the two countries are seen as needing improvements. Recently, there have been acknowledgments in the Korean public and political spheres that expanding relations with India should be a major economical and political priority for South Korea. Much of the economic investments of South Korea have been drained into China; however, South Korea is currently the fifth largest source of investment in India. To the Times of India, Roh Tae-woo voiced his opinion that co-operation between India's software and Korea's IT industries would bring very efficient and successful outcomes. The two countries agreed to shift their focus to the revision of the visa policies between the two countries, expansion of trade, and establishment of free trade agreement to encourage further investment between the two countries. Korean companies such as LG and Samsung have established manufacturing and service facilities in India, and several Korean construction companies won grants for a portion of the many infrastructural building plans in India, such as the National Highways Development Project. Tata Motors' purchase of Daewoo Commercial Vehicles at the cost of US$102 million highlights India's investments in Korea, which consist mostly of subcontracting.In June 2012, India, a major importer of arms and military hardware planned eight warships from South Korea but cancelled it.
India-RoK relations have made great strides in recent years and have become truly multidimensional, spurred by a significant convergence of interests, mutual goodwill and high level exchanges. Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh paid an official visit to Seoul from 24–27 March 2012, pertaining to Nuclear Security Summits, which led to the deepening of bilateral strategic partnership that was forged during President Lee Myung-bak’s State visit to India. An agreement on visa simplification was signed on 25 March 2012 in the presence of the two leaders at the Blue House. A Joint Statement was also issued during PM's visit. PM had last visited Seoul from November 10–12, 2010 for the G20 Summit. Earlier President Smt. Pratibha Devisingh Patil came on a State Visit to RoK from 24–27 July 2011 during which the Civil Nuclear Energy Cooperation Agreement was signed. President Lee paid a landmark visit to India, as Chief Guest at India's Republic Day celebrations on 26 January 2010, when bilateral ties were raised to the level of Strategic Partnership. His visit preceded an equally successful State Visit to RoK by President Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam, in February 2006 that heralded a new vibrant phase in India-RoK relations. It interalia led to the launch of a Joint Task Force to conclude a bilateral Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA), which was signed by Minister for Commerce and Industry Shri Anand Sharma at Seoul on August 7, 2009.","['All Wikipedia articles written in Indian English', 'Articles with short description', 'Bilateral relations of India', 'Bilateral relations of South Korea', 'Commons category link is on Wikidata', 'India–Korea relations', 'India–South Korea relations', 'Use Indian English from June 2013', 'Webarchive template wayback links']","['Period', 'drama', 'action', 'romance']",SBS,"This drama tells the story of three siblings who grew up in the 1970’s.

It was not pursued, however, until after World War II.
In early 2008 the proposal came under renewed discussions by 10 senior Japanese lawmakers who established a new committee to pursue it. This was followed by a study group from both countries in early 2009 that agreed to form a committee for the creation of specific construction plans. Committee head Huh Moon-do, a former director of South Korea's National Unification Board and a key member of the former Chun Doo-hwan government, said the tunnel would help regional economics and would ""play a key role in pursuing bilateral free trade talks"" that are currently stalled.The proposed tunnel would be more than 200 km (120 mi) long and able to serve a portion of freight traffic, as well as some of the approximately 20,000 people who travel daily between the countries.

746,W,"South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (ROK), is a country in East Asia, constituting the southern part of the Korean Peninsula and lying to the east of the Asian mainland. The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time, ruling most of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia, under Gwanggaeto the Great. South Korea lies in the north temperate zone and has a predominantly mountainous terrain. It comprises an estimated 51.4 million residents distributed over 100,363 km2 (38,750 sq mi). Its capital and largest city is Seoul, with a population of around 10 million.
Archaeology indicates that the Korean Peninsula was inhabited by early humans starting from the Lower Paleolithic period (2.6 Ma–300 Ka). The history of Korea begins with the foundation of Gojoseon in 2333 BCE by the mythic king Dangun, but no archaeological evidence and writing was found from this period. The Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in 11th century BCE, and its existence and role has been controversial in the modern era. The written historical record on Gojoseon (Old Joseon) was first mentioned in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under Unified Silla in CE 668, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910). It was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. At the end of World War II, Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S. zones of occupations. A separate election was held in the U.S. zone in 1948 which led to the creation of the Republic of Korea (ROK), while the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was established in the Soviet zone. The United Nations at the time passed a resolution declaring the ROK to be the only lawful government in Korea.The Korean War began in June 1950 when forces from North Korea invaded South Korea. The war lasted three years and involved the U.S., China, the Soviet Union and several other nations. The border between the two nations remains the most heavily fortified in the world. Under long-time military leader Park Chung-hee, the South Korean economy grew significantly and the country was transformed into a G-20 major economy. Military rule ended in 1987, and the country is now a presidential republic consisting of 17 administrative divisions.

759,Secret Forest,"The contemporary culture of South Korea developed from the traditional culture of Korea which was prevalent in the early Korean nomadic tribes. By maintaining thousands of years of ancient Korean culture, with influence from ancient Chinese culture, South Korea split on its own path of cultural development away from North Korean culture since the division of Korea in 1948. The industrialization, urbanization and westernization of South Korea, especially Seoul, have brought many changes to the way Korean people live. Changing economics and lifestyles have led to a concentration of population in major cities (and depopulation of the rural countryside), with multi-generational households separating into nuclear family living arrangements. Today, many Korean cultural elements, especially popular culture, have spread across the globe and became one of the most prominent cultural forces in the world.

North Korea is a one-party state run by the Kim dynasty. South Korea was formerly governed by one-party military dictatorships until 1987 when it held direct elections. Both nations claim the entire Korean peninsula. Both nations joined the United Nations in 1991 and are recognized by most  member states. Since the 1970s, both nations started informal diplomatic dialogues in order to ease military tensions. In 2000, President of South Korea Kim Dae-jung became the first president to visit North Korea, 55 years after the peninsula was divided.
In 2018, beginning with North Korea's participation in the 2018 Winter Olympics, the relationship has seen a major diplomatic breakthrough and become significantly warmer.

767,Nine: 9 Times Time Travel,"South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (ROK), is a country in East Asia, constituting the southern part of the Korean Peninsula and lying to the east of the Asian mainland. The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time, ruling most of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia, under Gwanggaeto the Great. South Korea lies in the north temperate zone and has a predominantly mountainous terrain. It comprises an estimated 51.4 million residents distributed over 100,363 km2 (38,750 sq mi). Its capital and largest city is Seoul, with a population of around 10 million.
Archaeology indicates that the Korean Peninsula was inhabited by early humans starting from the Lower Paleolithic period (2.6 Ma–300 Ka). The history of Korea begins with the foundation of Gojoseon in 2333 BCE by the mythic king Dangun, but no archaeological evidence and writing was found from this period. The Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in 11th century BCE, and its existence and role has been controversial in the modern era. The written historical record on Gojoseon (Old Joseon) was first mentioned in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under Unified Silla in CE 668, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910). It was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. At the end of World War II, Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S. zones of occupations. A separate election was held in the U.S. zone in 1948 which led to the creation of the Republic of Korea (ROK), while the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was established in the Soviet zone. The United Nations at the time passed a resolution declaring the ROK to be the only lawful government in Korea.The Korean War began in June 1950 when forces from North Korea invaded South Korea. The war lasted three years and involved the U.S., China, the Soviet Union and several other nations. The border between the two nations remains the most heavily fortified in the world. Under long-time military leader Park Chung-hee, the South Korean economy grew significantly and the country was transformed into a G-20 major economy. Military rule ended in 1987, and the country is now a presidential republic consisting of 17 administrative divisions.
South Korea is a highly developed country and a high-income economy, with a ""very high"" Human Development Index, ranking 22nd in the world. The country is considered a regional power and is the world's 11th largest economy by nominal GDP and the 12th largest by PPP as of 2010. South Korea is a global leader in the industrial and technological sectors, being the world's 5th largest exporter and 8th largest importer. Its export-driven economy primarily focuses production on electronics, automobiles, ships, machinery, petrochemicals and robotics. South Korea is a member of the ASEAN Plus mechanism, the United Nations, Uniting for Consensus, G20, the WTO and OECD and is a founding member of APEC and the East Asia Summit.","['1948 establishments

768,The Road Home,"South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (ROK), is a country in East Asia, constituting the southern part of the Korean Peninsula and lying to the east of the Asian mainland. The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time, ruling most of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia, under Gwanggaeto the Great. South Korea lies in the north temperate zone and has a predominantly mountainous terrain. It comprises an estimated 51.4 million residents distributed over 100,363 km2 (38,750 sq mi). Its capital and largest city is Seoul, with a population of around 10 million.
Archaeology indicates that the Korean Peninsula was inhabited by early humans starting from the Lower Paleolithic period (2.6 Ma–300 Ka). The history of Korea begins with the foundation of Gojoseon in 2333 BCE by the mythic king Dangun, but no archaeological evidence and writing was found from this period. The Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in 11th century BCE, and its existence and role has been controversial in the modern era. The written historical record on Gojoseon (Old Joseon) was first mentioned in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under Unified Silla in CE 668, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910). It was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. At the end of World War II, Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S. zones of occupations. A separate election was held in the U.S. zone in 1948 which led to the creation of the Republic of Korea (ROK), while the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was established in the Soviet zone. The United Nations at the time passed a resolution declaring the ROK to be the only lawful government in Korea.The Korean War began in June 1950 when forces from North Korea invaded South Korea. The war lasted three years and involved the U.S., China, the Soviet Union and several other nations. The border between the two nations remains the most heavily fortified in the world. Under long-time military leader Park Chung-hee, the South Korean economy grew significantly and the country was transformed into a G-20 major economy. Military rule ended in 1987, and the country is now a presidential republic consisting of 17 administrative divisions.
South Korea is a highly developed country and a high-income economy, with a ""very high"" Human Development Index, ranking 22nd in the world. The country is considered a regional power and is the world's 11th largest economy by nominal GDP and the 12th largest by PPP as of 2010. South Korea is a global leader in the industrial and technological sectors, being the world's 5th largest exporter and 8th largest importer. Its export-driven economy primarily focuses production on electronics, automobiles, ships, machinery, petrochemicals and robotics. South Korea is a member of the ASEAN Plus mechanism, the United Nations, Uniting for Consensus, G20, the WTO and OECD and is a founding member of APEC and the East Asia Summit.","['1948 establishments in South Korea', 'All Wikipedia articles in need of updating', 'All articles containing potentially dated statements', 'All articles with dead external links', 'All articles with self-published sources', 'All articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Articles containing Korean-language text', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2005', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2010', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2016', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2018', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from May 2009', 'Articles with Curlie links', 'Articles with French-language external links', 'Articles with Korean-language external links', 'Articles with dead external links from April 2017', 'Articles with dead external links from February 2009', 'Articles with dead external links from July 2017', 'Articles with hAudio microformats', 'Articles with obsolete information from March 2012', 'Articles with permanently dead external links', 'Articles with self-published sources from December 2017', 'Articles with short description', 'Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from May 2012', 'Articles with unsourced statements from June 2018', 'CS1 Chinese-language sources (zh)', 'CS1 Korean-language sources (ko)', 'CS1 maint: BOT: original-url status unknown', 'CS1 uses Chinese-language script (zh)', 'CS1 uses Korean-language script (ko)', 'Coordinates on Wikidata', 'East Asian countries', 'G20 nations', 'Korea', 'Korean-speaking countries and territories', 'Member states of the United Nations', 'Northeast Asian countries', 'Official website different in Wikidata and Wikipedia', 'Pages using infobox country or infobox former country with the symbol caption or type parameters', 'Republics', 'South Korea', 'States and territories established in 1948', 'Use mdy dates from November 2017', 'Webarchive template wayback links', 'Webarchive template webcite links', 'Wikipedia articles incorporating text from the World Factbook', 'Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with MusicBrainz area identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with WorldCat-VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages']","['Romance', 'family']",,"><p><img alt="""" class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-22933"" height=""571"" sizes=""(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"" src=""https://www.koreandrama.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/The-Road-Home-01.jpg"" srcset=""https://www.koreandrama.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/The-Road-Home-01.jpg 400w, https://www.koreandrama.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/The-Road-Home-01-105x150.jpg 105w, https://www.koreandrama.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/The-Road-Home-01-210x300.jpg 210w"" title=""The Road Home 01"" width=""400""/></p><p>Title: 집으로 가는 길 / The Road Home<br/> Chinese title : 回家的路上<br/> Also known as: On The Way Home<br/> Genre: Romance, family<br/> Episodes: 120<br/> Broadcast Network: <a href=""https://www.koreandrama.org/?tag=kbs1"" target=""_blank"">KBS1</a><br/> Broadcast period: 2009-Jan-12 to 2009-June-26<br/> Air time: Monday to Friday 20:25</p><p><span id=""more-757""></span></p><p><strong>Synopsis </strong></p><p>Yoo Min Soo (Shim Hyung Tak) is the eldest son of a hospital’s CEO.

778,Life,"South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (ROK), is a country in East Asia, constituting the southern part of the Korean Peninsula and lying to the east of the Asian mainland. The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time, ruling most of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia, under Gwanggaeto the Great. South Korea lies in the north temperate zone and has a predominantly mountainous terrain. It comprises an estimated 51.4 million residents distributed over 100,363 km2 (38,750 sq mi). Its capital and largest city is Seoul, with a population of around 10 million.
Archaeology indicates that the Korean Peninsula was inhabited by early humans starting from the Lower Paleolithic period (2.6 Ma–300 Ka). The history of Korea begins with the foundation of Gojoseon in 2333 BCE by the mythic king Dangun, but no archaeological evidence and writing was found from this period. The Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in 11th century BCE, and its existence and role has been controversial in the modern era. The written historical record on Gojoseon (Old Joseon) was first mentioned in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under Unified Silla in CE 668, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910). It was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. At the end of World War II, Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S. zones of occupations. A separate election was held in the U.S. zone in 1948 which led to the creation of the Republic of Korea (ROK), while the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was established in the Soviet zone. The United Nations at the time passed a resolution declaring the ROK to be the only lawful government in Korea.The Korean War began in June 1950 when forces from North Korea invaded South Korea. The war lasted three years and involved the U.S., China, the Soviet Union and several other nations. The border between the two nations remains the most heavily fortified in the world. Under long-time military leader Park Chung-hee, the South Korean economy grew significantly and the country was transformed into a G-20 major economy. Military rule ended in 1987, and the country is now a presidential republic consisting of 17 administrative divisions.
South Korea is a highly developed country and a high-income economy, with a ""very high"" Human Development Index, ranking 22nd in the world. The country is considered a regional power and is the world's 11th largest economy by nominal GDP and the 12th largest by PPP as of 2010. South Korea is a global leader in the industrial and technological sectors, being the world's 5th largest exporter and 8th largest importer. Its export-driven economy primarily focuses production on electronics, automobiles, ships, machinery, petrochemicals and robotics. South Korea is a member of the ASEAN Plus mechanism, the United Nations, Uniting for Consensus, G20, the WTO and OECD and is a founding member of APEC and the East Asia Summit.","['1948 establishments in South Korea', 'All Wikipedia articles in need of updating', 'All articles containing potentially dated statements', 'All articles with dead external links', 'All articles with self-published sources', 'All articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Articles containing Korean-language text', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2005', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2010', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2016', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2018', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from May 2009', 'Articles with Curlie links', 'Articles with French-language external links', 'Articles with Korean-language external links', 'Articles with dead external links from April 2017', 'Articles with dead external links from February 2009', 'Articles with dead external links from July 2017', 'Articles with hAudio microformats', 'Articles with obsolete information from March 2012', 'Articles with permanently dead external links', 'Articles with self-published sources from December 2017', 'Articles with short description', 'Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from May 2012', 'Articles with unsourced statements from June 2018', 'CS1 Chinese-language sources (zh)', 'CS1 Korean-language sources (ko)', 'CS1 maint: BOT: original-url status unknown', 'CS1 uses Chinese-language script (zh)', 'CS1 uses Korean-language script (ko)', 'Coordinates on Wikidata', 'East Asian countries', 'G20 nations', 'Korea', 'Korean-speaking countries and territories', 'Member states of the United Nations', 'Northeast Asian countries', 'Official website different in Wikidata and Wikipedia', 'Pages using infobox country or infobox former country with the symbol caption or type parameters', 'Republics', 'South Korea', 'States and territories established in 1948', 'Use mdy dates from November 2017', 'Webarchive template wayback links', 'Webarchive template webcite links', 'Wikipedia articles incorporating text from the World Factbook', 'Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with MusicBrainz area identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with WorldCat-VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages']",['Medical'],jTBC,"This drama tell the story of the power struggles in a hospital.</p><p>Ye Jin Woo (<a href=""http://star.koreandrama.org/lee-dong-wook/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Lee Dong Wook</a>) is a doctor in the emergency medical center at Sangkook University Hospital.

798,Rock Rock Rock,"In archaeology, rock art is human-made markings placed on natural stone; it is largely synonymous with parietal art. A global phenomenon, rock art is found in many culturally diverse regions of the world. It has been produced in many contexts throughout human history, although the majority of rock art that has been ethnographically recorded has been produced as a part of ritual. Such artworks are often divided into three forms: petroglyphs, which are carved into the rock surface, pictographs, which are painted onto the surface, and earth figures, formed on the ground.  The oldest known rock art dates from the Upper Palaeolithic period, having been found in Europe, Australia, Asia and Africa. Archaeologists studying these artworks believe that they likely had magico-religious significance.
The archaeological sub-discipline of rock art studies first developed in the late-19th century among Francophone scholars studying the Upper Palaeolithic rock art found in the cave systems of Western Europe. Rock art continues to be of importance to indigenous peoples in various parts of the world, who view them as both sacred items and significant components of their cultural patrimony. Such archaeological sites are also significant sources of cultural tourism, and have been utilised in popular culture for their aesthetic qualities.Normally found in literate cultures, a rock relief or rock-cut relief is a relief sculpture carved on solid or ""living rock"" such as a cliff, rather than a detached piece of stone. They are a category of rock art, and sometimes found in conjunction with rock-cut architecture.  However, they tend to be omitted in most works on rock art, which concentrate on engravings and paintings by prehistoric peoples.  A few such works exploit the natural contours of the rock and use them to define an image, but they do not amount to man-made reliefs. Rock reliefs have been made in many cultures, and were especially important in the art of the Ancient Near East.  Rock reliefs are generally fairly large, as they need to be to make an impact in the open air. Most have figures that are over life-size, and in many the figures are multiples of life-size.
Stylistically they normally relate to other types of sculpture from the culture and period concerned, and except for Hittite and Persian examples they are generally discussed as part of that wider subject. The vertical relief is most common, but reliefs on essentially horizontal surfaces are also found.  The term typically excludes relief carvings inside caves, whether natural or themselves man-made, which are especially found in India. Natural rock formations made into statues or other sculpture in the round, most famously at the Great Sphinx of Giza, are also usually excluded. Reliefs on large boulders left in their natural location, like the Hittite İmamkullu relief, are likely to be included, but smaller boulders may be called stelae or carved orthostats.","['All articles with dead external links', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Art media', 'Articles with dead external links from November 2018', 'Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from March 2018', 'Articles with unsourced statements from October 2012', 'Interlanguage link template link number', 'Prehistoric art', 'Rock art']","['Docu-drama', 'music']",KBS2,"A docu-drama about the life of Kim Tae Won, lead guitarist of the legendary rock band Boohwal, or “Resurrection”, as well as the different people who played a part in its history, such as former lead vocalist Lee Seung Chul."

801,Can Anyone Love,"South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (ROK), is a country in East Asia, constituting the southern part of the Korean Peninsula and lying to the east of the Asian mainland. The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time, ruling most of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia, under Gwanggaeto the Great. South Korea lies in the north temperate zone and has a predominantly mountainous terrain. It comprises an estimated 51.4 million residents distributed over 100,363 km2 (38,750 sq mi). Its capital and largest city is Seoul, with a population of around 10 million.
Archaeology indicates that the Korean Peninsula was inhabited by early humans starting from the Lower Paleolithic period (2.6 Ma–300 Ka). The history of Korea begins with the foundation of Gojoseon in 2333 BCE by the mythic king Dangun, but no archaeological evidence and writing was found from this period. The Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in 11th century BCE, and its existence and role has been controversial in the modern era. The written historical record on Gojoseon (Old Joseon) was first mentioned in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under Unified Silla in CE 668, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910). It was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. At the end of World War II, Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S. zones of occupations. A separate election was held in the U.S. zone in 1948 which led to the creation of the Republic of Korea (ROK), while the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was established in the Soviet zone. The United Nations at the time passed a resolution declaring the ROK to be the only lawful government in Korea.The Korean War began in June 1950 when forces from North Korea invaded South Korea. The war lasted three years and involved the U.S., China, the Soviet Union and several other nations. The border between the two nations remains the most heavily fortified in the world. Under long-time military leader Park Chung-hee, the South Korean economy grew significantly and the country was transformed into a G-20 major economy. Military rule ended in 1987, and the country is now a presidential republic consisting of 17 administrative divisions.
South Korea is a highly developed country and a high-income economy, with a ""very high"" Human Development Index, ranking 22nd in the world. The country is considered a regional power and is the world's 11th largest economy by nominal GDP and the 12th largest by PPP as of 2010. South Korea is a global leader in the industrial and technological sectors, being the world's 5th largest exporter and 8th largest importer. Its export-driven economy primarily focuses production on electronics, automobiles, ships, machinery, petrochemicals and robotics. South Korea is a member of the ASEAN Plus mechanism, the United Nations, Uniting for Consensus, G20, the WTO and OECD and is a founding member of APEC and the East Asia Summit.","['1948 establishments in South Korea', 'All Wikipedia articles in need of updating', 'All articles containing potentially dated statements', 'All articles with dead external links', 'All articles with self-published sources', 'All articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Articles containing Korean-language text', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2005', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2010', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2016', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2018', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from May 2009', 'Articles with Curlie links', 'Articles with French-language external links', 'Articles with Korean-language external links', 'Articles with dead external links from April 2017', 'Articles with dead external links from February 2009', 'Articles with dead external links from July 2017', 'Articles with hAudio microformats', 'Articles with obsolete information from March 2012', 'Articles with permanently dead external links', 'Articles with self-published sources from December 2017', 'Articles with short description', 'Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from May 2012', 'Articles with unsourced statements from June 2018', 'CS1 Chinese-language sources (zh)', 'CS1 Korean-language sources (ko)', 'CS1 maint: BOT: original-url status unknown', 'CS1 uses Chinese-language script (zh)', 'CS1 uses Korean-language script (ko)', 'Coordinates on Wikidata', 'East Asian countries', 'G20 nations', 'Korea', 'Korean-speaking countries and territories', 'Member states of the United Nations', 'Northeast Asian countries', 'Official website different in Wikidata and Wikipedia', 'Pages using infobox country or infobox former country with the symbol caption or type parameters', 'Republics', 'South Korea', 'States and territories established in 1948', 'Use mdy dates from November 2017', 'Webarchive template wayback links', 'Webarchive template webcite links', 'Wikipedia articles incorporating text from the World Factbook', 'Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with MusicBrainz area identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with WorldCat-VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages']","['Family', 'Comedy']",SBS,"><p><img alt="""" class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-22919"" height=""592"" sizes=""(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"" src=""https://www.koreandrama.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/Can-Anyone-Love-01.jpg"" srcset=""https://www.koreandrama.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/Can-Anyone-Love-01.jpg 400w, https://www.koreandrama.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/Can-Anyone-Love-01-101x150.jpg 101w, https://www.koreandrama.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/Can-Anyone-Love-01-202x300.jpg 202w"" title=""Can Anyone Love 01"" width=""400""/></p><p>Title: 사랑은 아무나 하나 / Can Anyone Love<br/> Chinese title : 不是谁都能爱<br/> Also known as: Dare to Love / Love to Anybody<br/> Genre: Family, Comedy<br/> Episodes: 50<br/> Broadcast network: SBS<br/> Broadcast period: 2009-Mar-07 to 2009-August-23<br/> Air time: Saturday &amp; Sunday 20:50</p><p><span id=""more-777""></span></p><p><strong>Synopsis </strong></p><p>A comedy drama centering around 4 sisters.

His era name is Yeongnak and he is occasionally recorded as Yeongnak Taewang (""Supreme King"" or ""Emperor"" Yeongnak). Gwanggaeto's imperial reign title meant that Goguryeo was on equal standing as an empire with the imperial dynasties in China.Under Gwanggaeto, Goguryeo began a golden age, becoming a powerful empire and one of the great powers in East Asia. Gwanggaeto made enormous advances and conquests into: Western Manchuria against Khitan tribes; Inner Mongolia and the Maritime Province of Russia against numerous nations and tribes; and the Han River valley in central Korea to control over two-thirds of the Korean peninsula.In regard to the Korean peninsula, Gwanggaeto defeated Baekje, the then most powerful of the Three Kingdoms of Korea, in 396, capturing the capital city of Wiryeseong in present-day Seoul. In 399, Silla, the southeastern kingdom of Korea, sought aid from Goguryeo due to incursions by Baekje troops and their Wa allies from the Japanese archipelago. Gwanggaeto dispatched 50,000 expeditionary troops, crushing his enemies and securing Silla as a de facto protectorate; he thus subdued the other Korean kingdoms and achieved a loose unification of the Korean peninsula under Goguryeo. In his western campaigns, he defeated the Xianbei of the Later Yan empire and conquered the Liaodong peninsula, regaining the ancient domain of Gojoseon.Gwanggaeto's accomplishments are recorded on the Gwanggaeto Stele, erected in 414 at the supposed site of his tomb in Ji'an along the present-day China–North Korea border. Constructed by his son and successor Jangsu, the monument to Gwanggaeto the Great is the largest engraved stele in the world.","['374 births', '413 deaths', '4th-century monarchs in Asia', '5th-century monarchs in Asia', 'Articles containing Korean-language text', 'Articles with Korean-language external links', 'Articles with short description', 'CS1 Korean-language sources (ko)', 'Commons category link is on Wikidata', 'Goguryeo rulers', 'Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with WorldCat-VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia indefinitely move-protected pages', 'Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages']",['Historical'],,"If a man dreams, it will end as a dream.

820,Boarding House No. 24,"North Korea–United States relations refers to international relations between North Korea and the United States. The political and diplomatic relations between North Korea and the United States have been historically hostile, developing primarily during the Korean War. In recent years relations have been largely defined by North Korea's nuclear program – six tests of nuclear weapons, its development of long-range missiles capable of striking targets thousands of miles away, and its ongoing threats to strike the United States and South Korea with nuclear weapons and conventional forces. During his presidency, George W. Bush referred to North Korea as part of ""the Axis of Evil"" because of the threat of its nuclear capabilities.

Recently, North Korea and the United States of America have started some formal diplomacy after the first Trump-Kim Summit in 2018. Sweden acts as the protecting power of United States interests in North Korea for consular matters. Since the Korean War, the United States has maintained a strong military presence in South Korea. However, the United States has considered, de jure, South Korea as the sole legitimate representative of all of Korea.
Support among the American public for US forces to defend South Korea has increased steadily. While it was at a mere 26% in 1990, it has now nearly tripled to 62%. A majority of the American public also have a positive view of Moon Jae-in, the South Korean President as of 2017.In 2015, according to Gallup's annual World Affairs survey, only 9% of Americans have a favorable view of North Korea, while 87% of Americans have a negative view. According to a 2014 BBC World Service Poll, only 4% of Americans view North Korea's influence positively with 90% expressing a negative view, one of the most negative perceptions of North Korea in the world.
2017 marked a significant rise of tensions and amplified rhetoric from both sides as Donald Trump took the presidency, after it appeared that North Korea's nuclear weapons program was developing at a faster rate than previously thought. The increasing rhetoric (as well as Trump's more aggressive approach to handling North Korea), missile testing and increasing military presence on the Korean Peninsula sparked speculation of a nuclear conflict.
Despite fears of a massive conflict, a détente began to develop when on March 8, 2018, the White House confirmed that Trump would accept a meeting invitation from Kim Jong-un. At the time, they were supposed to meet in May. On May 15, 2018, North Korea cut off talks with South Korea and threatened to cancel the planned  U.S.-North Korea summit, citing military exercises between the United States and South Korea. This cancellation was quickly reversed when Trump received an uncharacteristically friendly reply from Kim. On June 12, 2018, Trump and Kim met at the summit in Singapore, in the first summit meeting between the leaders of the two countries. Over the course of the summit, the two leaders engaged in several discussions and signed a joint statement calling for security, stability, and lasting peace. On February 22, 2019 an armed commando assaulted the North Korean embassy in Madrid, Spain; two of the members were later identified as CIA operatives. A second summit between Trump and Kim occurred on February 27 and 28, 2019 in Vietnam regarding North Korea's nuclear program, but ended abruptly without an agreement.","['All articles with dead external links', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Articles slanted towards recent events from September 2017', 'Articles with dead external links from September 2010', 'Articles with short description', 'Articles with unsourced statements from April 2017', 'Articles with unsourced statements from February 2018', 'Articles with unsourced statements from January 2019', 'Articles with unsourced statements from October 2018', 'Articles with unsourced statements from September 2017', 'Bilateral relations of North Korea', 'Bilateral relations of the United States', 'CS1 Spanish-language sources (es)', 'CS1 maint: Multiple names: authors list', 'CS1 maint: Uses authors parameter', 'North Korea–United States relations', 'Use mdy dates from December 2015', 'Webarchive template wayback links']","['Romance', 'Comedy', 'Sitcom']",MBC every1,"Six young people with different personalities and different backgrounds move into a boarding house together.

With surrounding Incheon metropolis and Gyeonggi province, Seoul forms the heart of the Seoul Capital Area. Seoul is ranked as the fourth largest metropolitan economy in the world and is larger than London and Paris.Strategically situated on the Han River, Seoul's history stretches back over two thousand years, when it was founded in 18 BCE by the people of Baekje, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. The city was later designated the capital of Korea under the Joseon dynasty. Seoul is surrounded by a mountainous and hilly landscape, with Bukhan Mountain located on the northern edge of the city. As with its long history, the Seoul Capital Area contains five UNESCO World Heritage Sites: Changdeok Palace, Hwaseong Fortress, Jongmyo Shrine, Namhansanseong and the Royal Tombs of the Joseon Dynasty. More recently, Seoul has been a major site of modern architectural construction – major modern landmarks include the N Seoul Tower, the 63 Building, the Lotte World Tower, the Dongdaemun Design Plaza, Lotte World, Trade Tower, COEX, and the IFC Seoul. Seoul was named the 2010 World Design Capital. As the birthplace of K-pop and the Korean Wave, Seoul received over 10 million international visitors in 2014, making it the world's 9th most visited city and 4th largest earner in tourism.Today, Seoul is considered a leading and rising global city, resulting from the South Korean economic boom - commonly referred to as the Miracle on the Han River - which transformed it into the world's 7th largest metropolitan economy with a GDP of US$635.4 billion in 2014 after Tokyo, New York City and Los Angeles. International visitors generally reach Seoul via AREX from the Incheon International Airport, notable for having been rated the best airport for nine consecutive years (2005–2013) by the Airports Council International. In 2015, it was rated Asia's most livable city with the second highest quality of life globally by Arcadis, with the GDP per capita (PPP) in Seoul being $39,786. Inhabitants of Seoul are faced with a high cost of living, for which the city was ranked 6th globally in 2017. Seoul is also an extremely expensive real estate market, ranked 5th in the world for the price of apartments in the downtown center. With major technology hubs centered in Gangnam and Digital Media City, the Seoul Capital Area is home to the headquarters of 15 Fortune Global 500 companies, including Samsung, LG, and Hyundai. Ranked sixth in the Global Power City Index and Global Financial Centres Index, the metropolis exerts a major influence in global affairs as one of the five leading hosts of global conferences. Seoul has hosted the 1986 Asian Games, 1988 Summer Olympics, 2002 FIFA World Cup, and more recently the 2010 G-20 Seoul summit.","['All articles containing potentially dated statements', 'All articles with dead external links', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Articles containing Chinese-language text', 'Articles containing Japanese-language text', 'Articles containing Korean-language text', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2009', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2010', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2012', 'Articles containing simplified Chinese-language text', 'Articles containing traditional Chinese-language text', 'Articles with Korean-language external links', 'Articles with dead external links from September 2018', 'Articles with hAudio microformats', 'Articles with short description', 'Articles with unsourced statements from September 2010', 'CS1 Korean-language sources (ko)', 'CS1 uses Korean-language script (ko)', 'Capitals in Asia', 'Coordinates on Wikidata', 'Pages using the Kartographer extension', 'Seoul', 'Seoul Capital Area', 'Special Cities and Metropolitan Cities of South Korea', 'Use mdy dates from November 2018', 'Webarchive template wayback links', 'Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with MusicBrainz area identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with WorldCat-VIAF identifiers']",['Horror'],,"Ha Na and Doo Na were twin sisters who were very close to each other until Doo Na died a terrible death.

839,The Player,"South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (ROK), is a country in East Asia, constituting the southern part of the Korean Peninsula and lying to the east of the Asian mainland. The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time, ruling most of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia, under Gwanggaeto the Great. South Korea lies in the north temperate zone and has a predominantly mountainous terrain. It comprises an estimated 51.4 million residents distributed over 100,363 km2 (38,750 sq mi). Its capital and largest city is Seoul, with a population of around 10 million.
Archaeology indicates that the Korean Peninsula was inhabited by early humans starting from the Lower Paleolithic period (2.6 Ma–300 Ka). The history of Korea begins with the foundation of Gojoseon in 2333 BCE by the mythic king Dangun, but no archaeological evidence and writing was found from this period. The Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in 11th century BCE, and its existence and role has been controversial in the modern era. The written historical record on Gojoseon (Old Joseon) was first mentioned in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under Unified Silla in CE 668, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910). It was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. At the end of World War II, Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S. zones of occupations. A separate election was held in the U.S. zone in 1948 which led to the creation of the Republic of Korea (ROK), while the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was established in the Soviet zone. The United Nations at the time passed a resolution declaring the ROK to be the only lawful government in Korea.The Korean War began in June 1950 when forces from North Korea invaded South Korea. The war lasted three years and involved the U.S., China, the Soviet Union and several other nations. The border between the two nations remains the most heavily fortified in the world. Under long-time military leader Park Chung-hee, the South Korean economy grew significantly and the country was transformed into a G-20 major economy. Military rule ended in 1987, and the country is now a presidential republic consisting of 17 administrative divisions.
South Korea is a highly developed country and a high-income economy, with a ""very high"" Human Development Index, ranking 22nd in the world. The country is considered a regional power and is the world's 11th largest economy by nominal GDP and the 12th largest by PPP as of 2010. South Korea is a global leader in the industrial and technological sectors, being the world's 5th largest exporter and 8th largest importer.

855,What’s Up?,"South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (ROK), is a country in East Asia, constituting the southern part of the Korean Peninsula and lying to the east of the Asian mainland. The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time, ruling most of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia, under Gwanggaeto the Great. South Korea lies in the north temperate zone and has a predominantly mountainous terrain. It comprises an estimated 51.4 million residents distributed over 100,363 km2 (38,750 sq mi). Its capital and largest city is Seoul, with a population of around 10 million.
Archaeology indicates that the Korean Peninsula was inhabited by early humans starting from the Lower Paleolithic period (2.6 Ma–300 Ka). The history of Korea begins with the foundation of Gojoseon in 2333 BCE by the mythic king Dangun, but no archaeological evidence and writing was found from this period. The Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in 11th century BCE, and its existence and role has been controversial in the modern era. The written historical record on Gojoseon (Old Joseon) was first mentioned in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under Unified Silla in CE 668, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910). It was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. At the end of World War II, Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S. zones of occupations. A separate election was held in the U.S. zone in 1948 which led to the creation of the Republic of Korea (ROK), while the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was established in the Soviet zone. The United Nations at the time passed a resolution declaring the ROK to be the only lawful government in Korea.The Korean War began in June 1950 when forces from North Korea invaded South Korea. The war lasted three years and involved the U.S., China, the Soviet Union and several other nations. The border between the two nations remains the most heavily fortified in the world. Under long-time military leader Park Chung-hee, the South Korean economy grew significantly and the country was transformed into a G-20 major economy. Military rule ended in 1987, and the country is now a presidential republic consisting of 17 administrative divisions.
South Korea is a highly developed country and a high-income economy, with a ""very high"" Human Development Index, ranking 22nd in the world. The country is considered a regional power and is the world's 11th largest economy by nominal GDP and the 12th largest by PPP as of 2010. South Korea is a global leader in the industrial and technological sectors, being the world's 5th largest exporter and 8th largest importer. Its export-driven economy primarily focuses production on electronics, automobiles, ships, machinery, petrochemicals and robotics. South Korea is a member of the ASEAN Plus mechanism, the United Nations, Uniting for Consensus, G20, the WTO and OECD and is a founding member of APEC and the East Asia Summit.","['1948 establishments in South Korea', 'All Wikipedia articles in need of updating', 'All articles containing potentially dated statements', 'All articles with dead external links', 'All articles with self-published sources', 'All articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Articles containing Korean-language text', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2005', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2010', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2016', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2018', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from May 2009', 'Articles with Curlie links', 'Articles with French-language external links', 'Articles with Korean-language external links', 'Articles with dead external links from April 2017', 'Articles with dead external links from February 2009', 'Articles with dead external links from July 2017', 'Articles with hAudio microformats', 'Articles with obsolete information from March 2012', 'Articles with permanently dead external links', 'Articles with self-published sources from December 2017', 'Articles with short description', 'Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from May 2012', 'Articles with unsourced statements from June 2018', 'CS1 Chinese-language sources (zh)', 'CS1 Korean-language sources (ko)', 'CS1 maint: BOT: original-url status unknown', 'CS1 uses Chinese-language script (zh)', 'CS1 uses Korean-language script (ko)', 'Coordinates on Wikidata', 'East Asian countries', 'G20 nations', 'Korea', 'Korean-speaking countries and territories', 'Member states of the United Nations', 'Northeast Asian countries', 'Official website different in Wikidata and Wikipedia', 'Pages using infobox country or infobox former country with the symbol caption or type parameters', 'Republics', 'South Korea', 'States and territories established in 1948', 'Use mdy dates from November 2017', 'Webarchive template wayback links', 'Webarchive template webcite links', 'Wikipedia articles incorporating text from the World Factbook', 'Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with MusicBrainz area identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with WorldCat-VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages']","['Music', 'romance', 'school']",MBN,

878,Salaryman,"Suicide in South Korea is the 10th highest rate in the world according to the World Health Organization, as well as the second highest suicide rate in the OECD after Lithuania.The high suicide rates compared to other countries in the developed world is only exacerbated by the large amount of suicide among the elderly. One factor of suicide among elderly South Koreans is due to the amount of widespread poverty among senior citizens in South Korea, with nearly half of the country's elderly population living below the poverty line. Combined with a poorly-funded social safety net for the elderly, this can result in them killing themselves not to be a financial burden on their families, since the old social structure where children looked after their parents has largely disappeared in the 21st century. As a result, people living in rural areas tend to have higher suicide rates. This is due to extremely high rates of elderly discrimination, especially when applying for jobs, with 85.7% of those in their 50s experiencing discrimination. Age discrimination also directly correlates to suicide, on top of influencing poverty rates. Suicide is the number one cause of death among South Koreans aged 10 to 39.However, proactive government efforts to decrease the rate have shown effectiveness in 2014, when there were 27.3 suicides per 100,000 people, a 4.1% decline from the previous year (28.5 people) and the lowest in 6 years since 2008's 26.0 people.","['CS1 maint: BOT: original-url status unknown', 'Health in South Korea', 'Korean society', 'South Korean culture', 'Suicide in South Korea', 'Webarchive template wayback links']","['melodrama', 'Comedy']",SBS,"This drama is based of ‘<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Romance_of_the_Three_Kingdoms"" target=""_blank"">The Romance of the Three Kingdoms</a>‘ in set dark world of Salaryman workers.</p><p>This drama depicts the trial and tribulations of the average salaryman, from humble beginnings to success.

888,Enjoy Life,"South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (ROK), is a country in East Asia, constituting the southern part of the Korean Peninsula and lying to the east of the Asian mainland. The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time, ruling most of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia, under Gwanggaeto the Great. South Korea lies in the north temperate zone and has a predominantly mountainous terrain. It comprises an estimated 51.4 million residents distributed over 100,363 km2 (38,750 sq mi). Its capital and largest city is Seoul, with a population of around 10 million.
Archaeology indicates that the Korean Peninsula was inhabited by early humans starting from the Lower Paleolithic period (2.6 Ma–300 Ka). The history of Korea begins with the foundation of Gojoseon in 2333 BCE by the mythic king Dangun, but no archaeological evidence and writing was found from this period. The Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in 11th century BCE, and its existence and role has been controversial in the modern era. The written historical record on Gojoseon (Old Joseon) was first mentioned in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under Unified Silla in CE 668, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910). It was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. At the end of World War II, Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S. zones of occupations. A separate election was held in the U.S. zone in 1948 which led to the creation of the Republic of Korea (ROK), while the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was established in the Soviet zone. The United Nations at the time passed a resolution declaring the ROK to be the only lawful government in Korea.The Korean War began in June 1950 when forces from North Korea invaded South Korea. The war lasted three years and involved the U.S., China, the Soviet Union and several other nations. The border between the two nations remains the most heavily fortified in the world. Under long-time military leader Park Chung-hee, the South Korean economy grew significantly and the country was transformed into a G-20 major economy. Military rule ended in 1987, and the country is now a presidential republic consisting of 17 administrative divisions.
South Korea is a highly developed country and a high-income economy, with a ""very high"" Human Development Index, ranking 22nd in the world. The country is considered a regional power and is the world's 11th largest economy by nominal GDP and the 12th largest by PPP as of 2010. South Korea is a global leader in the industrial and technological sectors, being the world's 5th largest exporter and 8th largest importer. Its export-driven economy primarily focuses production on electronics, automobiles, ships, machinery, petrochemicals and robotics. South Korea is a member of the ASEAN Plus mechanism, the United Nations, Uniting for Consensus, G20, the WTO and OECD and is a founding member of APEC and the East Asia Summit.","['1948 establishments in South Korea', 'All Wikipedia articles in need of updating', 'All articles containing potentially dated statements', 'All articles with dead external links', 'All articles with self-published sources', 'All articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Articles containing Korean-language text', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2005', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2010', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2016', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2018', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from May 2009', 'Articles with Curlie links', 'Articles with French-language external links', 'Articles with Korean-language external links', 'Articles with dead external links from April 2017', 'Articles with dead external links from February 2009', 'Articles with dead external links from July 2017', 'Articles with hAudio microformats', 'Articles with obsolete information from March 2012', 'Articles with permanently dead external links', 'Articles with self-published sources from December 2017', 'Articles with short description', 'Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from May 2012', 'Articles with unsourced statements from June 2018', 'CS1 Chinese-language sources (zh)', 'CS1 Korean-language sources (ko)', 'CS1 maint: BOT: original-url status unknown', 'CS1 uses Chinese-language script (zh)', 'CS1 uses Korean-language script (ko)', 'Coordinates on Wikidata', 'East Asian countries', 'G20 nations', 'Korea', 'Korean-speaking countries and territories', 'Member states of the United Nations', 'Northeast Asian countries', 'Official website different in Wikidata and Wikipedia', 'Pages using infobox country or infobox former country with the symbol caption or type parameters', 'Republics', 'South Korea', 'States and territories established in 1948', 'Use mdy dates from November 2017', 'Webarchive template wayback links', 'Webarchive template webcite links', 'Wikipedia articles incorporating text from the World Factbook', 'Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with MusicBrainz area identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with WorldCat-VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages']","['Drama', 'family']",,A story about the love and married life of six married couples who are pigeonholed into six types of marital relationships!
889,I’ll Give You The Stars and The Moon,"Transformers: Dark of the Moon is a 2011 American science fiction action film directed by Michael Bay and based on the Transformers toy line. It is the third installment in the live-action Transformers film series, and is the sequel to 2009's Revenge of the Fallen. It is also the first film in the series not to be co-produced by DreamWorks, leaving Paramount Pictures as the sole distributor. The film stars Shia LaBeouf, Josh Duhamel, John Turturro, Tyrese Gibson, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Patrick Dempsey, Kevin Dunn, Julie White, John Malkovich, and Frances McDormand. Its story is set three years after the events of Revenge of the Fallen, and follows the warring Autobots and Decepticons as they battle to possess powerful technology from their homeworld that had crashed on Earth's moon. Returning Transformers include Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Ironhide, Ratchet, Sideswipe, Skids and Mudflap (as cameos), Wheelie, Megatron, Starscream, Soundwave, Barricade, Sideways, Long Haul, Scrapper, and Brawl. 
The script was written by Ehren Kruger, who also collaborated on the narrative of Revenge of the Fallen. Dark of the Moon employed both regular 35 mm film cameras and specially-developed 3-D cameras, with filming locations in Chicago, Florida, Indiana, Milwaukee, Moscow, and Washington, D.C.. The film was rendered specifically for 3-D, and the visual effects involved more complex robots which took longer to render. In May 2011, it was announced that Paramount would move Dark of the Moon's release date of July 1 to June 29, in order to monitor an early response to footage.
Exclusive early premieres in both select 3D and IMAX theaters took place on June 28, 2011, one night before worldwide release in 2D and 3D (including IMAX 3D) formats—each featuring Dolby Surround 7.1 sound. Metacritic characterized the reviews it cataloged as ""mixed or average"", and the Rotten Tomatoes critical consensus praised the special effects, action scenes, scores, 3D work, and the performances of Peter Cullen and Leonard Nimoy while criticizing the runtime and script. Dark of the Moon grossed over $1.1 billion worldwide, and is currently the 20th-highest-grossing film of all time (4th-highest at the time of release), the second-highest-grossing film of 2011 (behind Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2), the highest-grossing film in the Transformers series, and the tenth film to gross over $1 billion. Like the first film, it was nominated for Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Visual Effects at the 84th Academy Awards. It was followed by Transformers: Age of Extinction in 2014 and Transformers: The Last Knight in 2017.","['2010s action films', '2010s adventure films', '2010s science fiction films', '2010s sequel films', '2010s superhero films', '2011 3D films', '2011 films', 'Alien invasions in films', 'All articles containing potentially dated statements', 'All articles with dead external links', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'American 3D films', 'American action adventure films', 'American disaster films', 'American films', 'American science fiction action films', 'American sequel films', 'Apocalyptic fiction', 'Apocalyptic films', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from February 2012', 'Articles with dead external links from July 2018', 'Articles with dead external links from June 2016', 'Articles with hAudio microformats', 'Articles with inconsistent citation formats', 'Articles with permanently dead external links', 'Articles with unsourced statements from March 2019', 'Articles with unsourced statements from November 2013', 'Articles with unsourced statements from October 2015', 'Commons category link is on Wikidata', 'Di Bonaventura Pictures films', 'English-language films', 'Films about ancient astronauts', 'Films about the Apollo program', 'Films directed by Michael Bay', 'Films produced by Lorenzo di Bonaventura', 'Films scored by Steve Jablonsky', 'Films set in 1961', 'Films set in 2011', 'Films set in Africa', 'Films set in Cambodia', 'Films set in Chernobyl (city)', 'Films set in Chicago', 'Films set in Florida', 'Films set in Hong Kong', 'Films set in Ukraine', 'Films set in Washington, D.C.', 'Films set in the United States', 'Films shot in Africa', 'Films shot in Cambodia', 'Films shot in Chicago', 'Films shot in Detroit', 'Films shot in Florida', 'Films shot in Hong Kong', 'Films shot in Indiana', 'Films shot in Los Angeles', 'Films shot in Michigan', 'Films shot in Russia', 'Films shot in Washington, D.C.', 'Films shot in Wisconsin', 'Films using computer-generated imagery', 'Good articles', 'IMAX films', 'Impact event films', 'Live-action films based on animated series', 'Pages using multiple image with auto scaled images', 'Paramount Pictures films', 'Robot films', 'Science fiction adventure films', 'Screenplays by Ehren Kruger', 'Transformers (film series)', 'Use mdy dates from October 2015', 'Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with WorldCat-VIAF identifiers']","['Family', 'Romance']",,

900,The King and I,"South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (ROK), is a country in East Asia, constituting the southern part of the Korean Peninsula and lying to the east of the Asian mainland. The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time, ruling most of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia, under Gwanggaeto the Great. South Korea lies in the north temperate zone and has a predominantly mountainous terrain. It comprises an estimated 51.4 million residents distributed over 100,363 km2 (38,750 sq mi). Its capital and largest city is Seoul, with a population of around 10 million.
Archaeology indicates that the Korean Peninsula was inhabited by early humans starting from the Lower Paleolithic period (2.6 Ma–300 Ka). The history of Korea begins with the foundation of Gojoseon in 2333 BCE by the mythic king Dangun, but no archaeological evidence and writing was found from this period. The Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in 11th century BCE, and its existence and role has been controversial in the modern era. The written historical record on Gojoseon (Old Joseon) was first mentioned in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under Unified Silla in CE 668, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910). It was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. At the end of World War II, Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S. zones of occupations. A separate election was held in the U.S. zone in 1948 which led to the creation of the Republic of Korea (ROK), while the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was established in the Soviet zone. The United Nations at the time passed a resolution declaring the ROK to be the only lawful government in Korea.The Korean War began in June 1950 when forces from North Korea invaded South Korea. The war lasted three years and involved the U.S., China, the Soviet Union and several other nations. The border between the two nations remains the most heavily fortified in the world. Under long-time military leader Park Chung-hee, the South Korean economy grew significantly and the country was transformed into a G-20 major economy. Military rule ended in 1987, and the country is now a presidential republic consisting of 17 administrative divisions.
South Korea is a highly developed country and a high-income economy, with a ""very high"" Human Development Index, ranking 22nd in the world. The country is considered a regional power and is the world's 11th largest economy by nominal GDP and the 12th largest by PPP as of 2010.

A point is scored when a player fails to return the ball within the rules. Play is fast and demands quick reactions. Spinning the ball alters its trajectory and limits an opponent's options, giving the hitter a great advantage.
Table tennis is governed by the worldwide organization  International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF), founded in 1926. ITTF currently includes 226 member associations.

947,Ja Myung Go,"Ja Myung Go (Hangul: 자명고; RR: Jamyeonggo; also known as Princess Ja-myung) is a 2009 South Korean television series starring Jung Ryeo-won, Park Min-young and Jung Kyung-ho. It aired on SBS from March 9 to July 21, 2009 on Mondays and Tuesdays at 21:55 (KST) for 39 episodes.
It is based on the Korean folk tale Prince Hodong and the Princess of Nakrang, which touches the story of the failed Nakrang Kingdom. According to the tale, there was a famous drum called the jamyeonggo, literally ""the drum that beats by itself,"" that possessed the mysterious power to automatically sound an alarm whenever enemies would invade its kingdom. The self-sounding drum caused neighboring nations, including the warrior state of Goguryeo, to hesitate about attacking Nakrang. A prince of Goguryeo named Hodong infiltrated Nakrang with the mission of destroying the drum. But the prince unexpectedly fell in love with the princess of Nakrang. For her love, the princess eventually chose to tear off the drum to betray her country. As a result, her nation fell into ruin and she was killed. Prince Hodong mourned over her death, holding her body.
The period drama series, however, gives a new twist in that the drum is in fact a person, embodied by Ja-myung, the hidden sister of the Nakrang Kingdom's princess. Growing up as the princess of Nakrang, Ra-hee is adored by her people, while Ja-myung survives a murder attempt and lives as a commoner. Prince Hodong, from Nakrang's enemy, the Goguryeo Kingdom, is torn between two nations and two women, and must make a choice between love and duty.Ja Myung Go received low ratings in the single digits (it competed in the same timeslot as hits Queen of Housewives and Queen Seondeok), resulting in SBS cutting short the initial planned 50 episodes to 39.","['2009 South Korean television series debuts', '2009 South Korean television series endings', 'Articles containing Korean-language text', 'Articles with Korean-language external links', 'CS1 Thai-language sources (th)', 'HanCinema film ID same as Wikidata', 'Korean-language television programs', 'Martial arts television series', 'Seoul Broadcasting System television dramas', 'South Korean historical television series', 'Television series set in Goguryeo', 'Use dmy dates from April 2017']","['Historical', 'period', 'romance']",SBS,"><p><img alt="""" class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-22923"" height=""568"" sizes=""(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"" src=""https://www.koreandrama.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/Ja-Myung-Go-01.jpg"" srcset=""https://www.koreandrama.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/Ja-Myung-Go-01.jpg 400w, https://www.koreandrama.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/Ja-Myung-Go-01-105x150.jpg 105w, https://www.koreandrama.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/Ja-Myung-Go-01-211x300.jpg 211w"" title=""Ja Myung Go 01"" width=""400""/></p><p>Title: 자명고 / Ja Myung Go<br/> Chinese Title : 女王自鳴鼓<br/> Previously known as: 왕녀 자명고 / Princess Ja Myung Go<br/> Also known as: The Royal Princess of Ja Myung Go / The Story of Self Destruction<br/> Genre: Historical, period, romance<br/> Episodes: 39<br/> Broadcast network: SBS<br/> Broadcast period: 2009-March-09 to 2009-July-21<br/> Air time: Monday &amp; Tuesday 21:55</p><p><span id=""more-769""></span></p><p><strong>Synopsis </strong></p><p>Legend has it that more than 2000 years ago, the Kingdom of Nangnang possessed a mystical Ja Myung Drum (Ja Myung Go) which will sound by itself when enemies invade.

Princess Ja Myung and Princess Nak-Rang are born on the same day and time to the same father but different mothers. It is predicted that one princess will become the nation’s savior while the other will bring the entire nation down.

949,Golden Tower,"South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (ROK), is a country in East Asia, constituting the southern part of the Korean Peninsula and lying to the east of the Asian mainland. The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time, ruling most of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia, under Gwanggaeto the Great. South Korea lies in the north temperate zone and has a predominantly mountainous terrain. It comprises an estimated 51.4 million residents distributed over 100,363 km2 (38,750 sq mi). Its capital and largest city is Seoul, with a population of around 10 million.
Archaeology indicates that the Korean Peninsula was inhabited by early humans starting from the Lower Paleolithic period (2.6 Ma–300 Ka). The history of Korea begins with the foundation of Gojoseon in 2333 BCE by the mythic king Dangun, but no archaeological evidence and writing was found from this period. The Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in 11th century BCE, and its existence and role has been controversial in the modern era. The written historical record on Gojoseon (Old Joseon) was first mentioned in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under Unified Silla in CE 668, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910). It was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. At the end of World War II, Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S. zones of occupations. A separate election was held in the U.S. zone in 1948 which led to the creation of the Republic of Korea (ROK), while the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was established in the Soviet zone. The United Nations at the time passed a resolution declaring the ROK to be the only lawful government in Korea.The Korean War began in June 1950 when forces from North Korea invaded South Korea. The war lasted three years and involved the U.S., China, the Soviet Union and several other nations. The border between the two nations remains the most heavily fortified in the world. Under long-time military leader Park Chung-hee, the South Korean economy grew significantly and the country was transformed into a G-20 major economy. Military rule ended in 1987, and the country is now a presidential republic consisting of 17 administrative divisions.
South Korea is a highly developed country and a high-income economy, with a ""very high"" Human Development Index, ranking 22nd in the world. The country is considered a regional power and is the world's 11th largest economy by nominal GDP and the 12th largest by PPP as of 2010. South Korea is a global leader in the industrial and technological sectors, being the world's 5th largest exporter and 8th largest importer. Its export-driven economy primarily focuses production on electronics, automobiles, ships, machinery, petrochemicals and robotics. South Korea is a member of the ASEAN Plus mechanism, the United Nations, Uniting for Consensus, G20, the WTO and OECD and is a founding member of APEC and the East Asia Summit.","['1948 establishments in South Korea', 'All Wikipedia articles in need of updating', 'All articles containing potentially dated statements', 'All articles with dead external links', 'All articles with self-published sources', 'All articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Articles containing Korean-language text', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2005', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2010', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2016', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2018', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from May 2009', 'Articles with Curlie links', 'Articles with French-language external links', 'Articles with Korean-language external links', 'Articles with dead external links from April 2017', 'Articles with dead external links from February 2009', 'Articles with dead external links from July 2017', 'Articles with hAudio microformats', 'Articles with obsolete information from March 2012', 'Articles with permanently dead external links', 'Articles with self-published sources from December 2017', 'Articles with short description', 'Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from May 2012', 'Articles with unsourced statements from June 2018', 'CS1 Chinese-language sources (zh)', 'CS1 Korean-language sources (ko)', 'CS1 maint: BOT: original-url status unknown', 'CS1 uses Chinese-language script (zh)', 'CS1 uses Korean-language script (ko)', 'Coordinates on Wikidata', 'East Asian countries', 'G20 nations', 'Korea', 'Korean-speaking countries and territories', 'Member states of the United Nations', 'Northeast Asian countries', 'Official website different in Wikidata and Wikipedia', 'Pages using infobox country or infobox former country with the symbol caption or type parameters', 'Republics', 'South Korea', 'States and territories established in 1948', 'Use mdy dates from November 2017', 'Webarchive template wayback links', 'Webarchive template webcite links', 'Wikipedia articles incorporating text from the World Factbook', 'Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with MusicBrainz area identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with WorldCat-VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages']","['Family', 'Comedy']",tvN,"Based in a farming village, this drama deals with warm and realistic episodes."

This analogy was incorporated by Chang Myon, prime minister of the Second Republic of South Korea, in his New Year's address of 1961, in which he encouraged South Koreans to bear difficulties in the hope of achieving a similar economic upturn. The resultant growth has been attributed to the hard work of the labour force, in terms of which the phrase's use of ""miracle"" may be seen as a misnomer. Following the Miracle on the Han River, South Korea has been held as an economic model for other developing countriesand acceded to the G20 in November 2010, capping a successful sixty-some years of rebuilding and modernization.","['1950s in Seoul', '20th century in South Korea', 'All articles needing additional references', 'All articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Articles containing Korean-language text', 'Articles needing additional references from May 2016', 'Articles with short description', 'Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from November 2018', 'Articles with unsourced statements from May 2013', 'Economic booms', 'Economic history of South Korea', 'Economy of South Korea', 'Wikipedia articles needing clarification from November 2018']",['Family'],MBC,"Discovering that he is in the final stages of lung cancer, Jang Young Chul reassesses his life and begins to understand the meaning of family, love and work.

Other elements include sampling beats or bass lines from records (or synthesized beats and sounds), and rhythmic beatboxing. While often used to refer solely to rapping, ""hip hop"" more properly denotes the practice of the entire subculture. The term hip hop music is sometimes used synonymously with the term rap music, though rapping is not a required component of hip hop music; the genre may also incorporate other elements of hip hop culture, including DJing, turntablism, scratching, beatboxing, and instrumental tracks.","['1990s fads and trends', '2000s fads and trends', '2010s fads and trends', 'African-American cultural history', 'All articles lacking reliable references', 'All articles to be split', 'All articles with dead external links', 'All articles with self-published sources', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Article sections to be split from August 2018', 'Articles lacking reliable references from December 2018', 'Articles to be split from August 2018', 'Articles with dead external links from April 2017', 'Articles with dead external links from January 2011', 'Articles with permanently dead external links', 'Articles with self-published sources from December 2017', 'Articles with unsourced statements from August 2017', 'Articles with unsourced statements from December 2018', 'Articles with unsourced statements from July 2010', 'CS1 maint: BOT: original-url status unknown', 'CS1 maint: Multiple names: authors list', 'Commons category link from Wikidata', 'Hip hop', 'Musical improvisation', 'Radio formats', 'Use mdy dates from June 2017', 'Webarchive template wayback links', 'Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers', 'Wikipedia indefinitely move-protected pages', 'Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages']","['Music', 'School', 'Comedy']","jTBC, NAVER tvcast","In this drama, Gong Seul Ki (<a href=""http://star.koreandrama.org/lee-joo-young-1992/"" target=""_blank"">Lee Joo Young</a>) was an underground hiphop artist, but she now works as a music teacher at an elementary school.

975,Style,"South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (ROK), is a country in East Asia, constituting the southern part of the Korean Peninsula and lying to the east of the Asian mainland. The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time, ruling most of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia, under Gwanggaeto the Great. South Korea lies in the north temperate zone and has a predominantly mountainous terrain. It comprises an estimated 51.4 million residents distributed over 100,363 km2 (38,750 sq mi). Its capital and largest city is Seoul, with a population of around 10 million.
Archaeology indicates that the Korean Peninsula was inhabited by early humans starting from the Lower Paleolithic period (2.6 Ma–300 Ka). The history of Korea begins with the foundation of Gojoseon in 2333 BCE by the mythic king Dangun, but no archaeological evidence and writing was found from this period. The Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in 11th century BCE, and its existence and role has been controversial in the modern era. The written historical record on Gojoseon (Old Joseon) was first mentioned in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under Unified Silla in CE 668, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910). It was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. At the end of World War II, Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S. zones of occupations. A separate election was held in the U.S. zone in 1948 which led to the creation of the Republic of Korea (ROK), while the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was established in the Soviet zone. The United Nations at the time passed a resolution declaring the ROK to be the only lawful government in Korea.The Korean War began in June 1950 when forces from North Korea invaded South Korea. The war lasted three years and involved the U.S., China, the Soviet Union and several other nations. The border between the two nations remains the most heavily fortified in the world. Under long-time military leader Park Chung-hee, the South Korean economy grew significantly and the country was transformed into a G-20 major economy. Military rule ended in 1987, and the country is now a presidential republic consisting of 17 administrative divisions.
South Korea is a highly developed country and a high-income economy, with a ""very high"" Human Development Index, ranking 22nd in the world. The country is considered a regional power and is the world's 11th largest economy by nominal GDP and the 12th largest by PPP as of 2010. South Korea is a global leader in the industrial and technological sectors, being the world's 5th largest exporter and 8th largest importer. Its export-driven economy primarily focuses production on electronics, automobiles, ships, machinery, petrochemicals and robotics. South Korea is a member of the ASEAN Plus mechanism, the United Nations, Uniting for Consensus, G20, the WTO and OECD and is a founding member of APEC and the East Asia Summit.","['1948 establishments in South Korea', 'All Wikipedia articles in need of updating', 'All articles containing potentially dated statements', 'All articles with dead external links', 'All articles with self-published sources', 'All articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Articles containing Korean-language text', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2005', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2010', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2016', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2018', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from May 2009', 'Articles with Curlie links', 'Articles with French-language external links', 'Articles with Korean-language external links', 'Articles with dead external links from April 2017', 'Articles with dead external links from February 2009', 'Articles with dead external links from July 2017', 'Articles with hAudio microformats', 'Articles with obsolete information from March 2012', 'Articles with permanently dead external links', 'Articles with self-published sources from December 2017', 'Articles with short description', 'Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from May 2012', 'Articles with unsourced statements from June 2018', 'CS1 Chinese-language sources (zh)', 'CS1 Korean-language sources (ko)', 'CS1 maint: BOT: original-url status unknown', 'CS1 uses Chinese-language script (zh)', 'CS1 uses Korean-language script (ko)', 'Coordinates on Wikidata', 'East Asian countries', 'G20 nations', 'Korea', 'Korean-speaking countries and territories', 'Member states of the United Nations', 'Northeast Asian countries', 'Official website different in Wikidata and Wikipedia', 'Pages using infobox country or infobox former country with the symbol caption or type parameters', 'Republics', 'South Korea', 'States and territories established in 1948', 'Use mdy dates from November 2017', 'Webarchive template wayback links', 'Webarchive template webcite links', 'Wikipedia articles incorporating text from the World Factbook', 'Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with MusicBrainz area identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with WorldCat-VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages']",['Romance'],,"Lee Seo Jung has recently joined a fashion magazine company called Style.

978,Case Number 113,"The Korean War (in South Korean Hangul: 한국전쟁; Hanja: 韓國戰爭; RR: Hanguk Jeonjaeng, ""Korean War""; in North Korean Chosŏn'gŭl: 조국해방전쟁; Hancha: 祖國解放戰爭; MR: Choguk haebang chŏnjaeng, ""Fatherland: Liberation War""; 25 June 1950 – 27 July 1953) was a war between North Korea (with the support of China and the Soviet Union) and South Korea (with the support of the United Nations, with the principal support from the United States). The war began on 25 June 1950 when North Korea invaded South Korea following a series of clashes along the border.As a product of the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States, Korea had been split into two sovereign states in 1948. A socialist state was established in the north under the communist leadership of Kim Il-sung and a capitalist state in the south under the anti-communist leadership of Syngman Rhee. Both governments of the two new Korean states claimed to be the sole legitimate government of all of Korea, and neither accepted the border as permanent. The conflict escalated into warfare when North Korean military forces—supported by the Soviet Union and China—crossed the border and advanced south into South Korea on 25 June 1950. The United Nations Security Council authorized the formation and dispatch of UN forces to Korea to repel what was recognized as a North Korean invasion. Twenty-one countries of the United Nations eventually contributed to the UN force, with the United States providing around 90% of the military personnel.After the first two months of war, South Korean and U.S. forces rapidly dispatched to Korea were on the point of defeat, forced back to a small area in the south known as the Pusan Perimeter. In September 1950, an amphibious UN counter-offensive was launched at Incheon, and cut off many North Korean troops. Those who escaped envelopment and capture were forced back north. UN forces rapidly approached the Yalu River—the border with China—but in October 1950, mass Chinese forces crossed the Yalu and entered the war. The surprise Chinese intervention triggered a retreat of UN forces which continued until mid-1951.
In these reversals of fortune, Seoul changed hands four times, and the last two years of fighting became a war of attrition, with the front line close to the 38th parallel. The war in the air, however, was never a stalemate. North Korea was subject to a massive bombing campaign. Jet fighters confronted each other in air-to-air combat for the first time in history, and Soviet pilots covertly flew in defense of their communist allies.
The fighting ended on 27 July 1953, when an armistice was signed. The agreement created the Korean Demilitarized Zone to separate North and South Korea, and allowed the return of prisoners. However, no peace treaty was ever signed, and according to some sources the two Koreas are technically still at war, engaged in a frozen conflict. In April 2018, the leaders of North and South Korea met at the demilitarized zone and agreed to work towards a treaty to formally end the Korean War.","['1950s in North Korea', '1950s in South Korea', 'Aftermath of World War II', 'All Wikipedia articles written in American English', 'All articles containing potentially dated statements', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Articles containing Korean-language text', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2010', 'Articles containing simplified Chinese-language text', 'Articles containing traditional Chinese-language text', 'Articles with short description', 'Articles with unsourced statements from April 2018', 'Articles with unsourced statements from January 2018', 'CS1: long volume value', 'CS1 Chinese-language sources (zh)', 'CS1 Czech-language sources (cs)', 'CS1 French-language sources (fr)', 'CS1 German-language sources (de)', 'CS1 Hungarian-language sources (hu)', 'CS1 Korean-language sources (ko)', 'CS1 maint: Archived copy as title', 'CS1 maint: Multiple names: authors list', 'CS1 uses Chinese-language script (zh)', 'CS1 uses Korean-language script (ko)', 'Civil wars involving the states and peoples of Asia', 'Civil wars post-1945', 'Communism-based civil wars', 'Conflicts in 1950', 'Conflicts in 1951', 'Conflicts in 1952', 'Conflicts in 1953', 'History of Korea', 'Korean War', 'Proxy wars', 'Revolution-based civil wars', 'United Nations operations in Asia', 'Use American English from December 2012', 'Use dmy dates from April 2016', 'Wars involving Australia', 'Wars involving Belgium', 'Wars involving Canada', 'Wars involving Ethiopia', 'Wars involving France', 'Wars involving Greece', 'Wars involving Korea', 'Wars involving Luxembourg', 'Wars involving New Zealand', 'Wars involving North Korea', 'Wars involving South Africa', 'Wars involving South Korea', 'Wars involving Thailand', 'Wars involving Turkey', 'Wars involving the Netherlands', ""Wars involving the People's Republic of China"", 'Wars involving the Philippines', 'Wars involving the Soviet Union', 'Wars involving the United Kingdom', 'Wars involving the United States', 'Webarchive template archiveis links', 'Webarchive template wayback links', 'Wikipedia articles needing page number citations from April 2017', 'Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers', 'Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages']","['Family', 'Mystery', 'Crime']",SBS,"Based on Ryu Sung Hee’s novel about a murder case that leads to the quarrel and forgiveness of a family and highlights on the relationship between parents and their children.</p><p>Kang Hee Kyung is the well known Chief Surgeon of University Hospital.

996,Ready for Start,"South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (ROK), is a country in East Asia, constituting the southern part of the Korean Peninsula and lying to the east of the Asian mainland. The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time, ruling most of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia, under Gwanggaeto the Great. South Korea lies in the north temperate zone and has a predominantly mountainous terrain. It comprises an estimated 51.4 million residents distributed over 100,363 km2 (38,750 sq mi). Its capital and largest city is Seoul, with a population of around 10 million.
Archaeology indicates that the Korean Peninsula was inhabited by early humans starting from the Lower Paleolithic period (2.6 Ma–300 Ka). The history of Korea begins with the foundation of Gojoseon in 2333 BCE by the mythic king Dangun, but no archaeological evidence and writing was found from this period. The Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in 11th century BCE, and its existence and role has been controversial in the modern era. The written historical record on Gojoseon (Old Joseon) was first mentioned in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under Unified Silla in CE 668, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910). It was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. At the end of World War II, Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S. zones of occupations. A separate election was held in the U.S. zone in 1948 which led to the creation of the Republic of Korea (ROK), while the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was established in the Soviet zone. The United Nations at the time passed a resolution declaring the ROK to be the only lawful government in Korea.The Korean War began in June 1950 when forces from North Korea invaded South Korea. The war lasted three years and involved the U.S., China, the Soviet Union and several other nations. The border between the two nations remains the most heavily fortified in the world. Under long-time military leader Park Chung-hee, the South Korean economy grew significantly and the country was transformed into a G-20 major economy. Military rule ended in 1987, and the country is now a presidential republic consisting of 17 administrative divisions.
South Korea is a highly developed country and a high-income economy, with a ""very high"" Human Development Index, ranking 22nd in the world. The country is considered a regional power and is the world's 11th largest economy by nominal GDP and the 12th largest by PPP as of 2010. South Korea is a global leader in the industrial and technological sectors, being the world's 5th largest exporter and 8th largest importer. Its export-driven economy primarily focuses production on electronics, automobiles, ships, machinery, petrochemicals and robotics. South Korea is a member of the ASEAN Plus mechanism, the United Nations, Uniting for Consensus, G20, the WTO and OECD and is a founding member of APEC and the East Asia Summit.","['1948 establishments in South Korea', 'All Wikipedia articles in need of updating', 'All articles containing potentially dated statements', 'All articles with dead external links', 'All articles with self-published sources', 'All articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Articles containing Korean-language text', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2005', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2010', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2016', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2018', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from May 2009', 'Articles with Curlie links', 'Articles with French-language external links', 'Articles with Korean-language external links', 'Articles with dead external links from April 2017', 'Articles with dead external links from February 2009', 'Articles with dead external links from July 2017', 'Articles with hAudio microformats', 'Articles with obsolete information from March 2012', 'Articles with permanently dead external links', 'Articles with self-published sources from December 2017', 'Articles with short description', 'Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from May 2012', 'Articles with unsourced statements from June 2018', 'CS1 Chinese-language sources (zh)', 'CS1 Korean-language sources (ko)', 'CS1 maint: BOT: original-url status unknown', 'CS1 uses Chinese-language script (zh)', 'CS1 uses Korean-language script (ko)', 'Coordinates on Wikidata', 'East Asian countries', 'G20 nations', 'Korea', 'Korean-speaking countries and territories', 'Member states of the United Nations', 'Northeast Asian countries', 'Official website different in Wikidata and Wikipedia', 'Pages using infobox country or infobox former country with the symbol caption or type parameters', 'Republics', 'South Korea', 'States and territories established in 1948', 'Use mdy dates from November 2017', 'Webarchive template wayback links', 'Webarchive template webcite links', 'Wikipedia articles incorporating text from the World Factbook', 'Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with MusicBrainz area identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with WorldCat-VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages']",['BlackComedy'],NAVER tvcast,"Based on writer Lee Hyun Min (이현민)’s original web-toon which had more than 1 million views a day when it was published on Naver, this black comedy is about the daily lives of employees in an advertisement agency and their competitive working environment."

They are often cited as one of the most influential acts to shape the K-pop industry by helping spread the Korean Wave internationally and dubbed as  the ""Kings of K-pop"" by the media. Their experimental and diverse use of music genres, personal involvement in producing their own records, and stage performances have been admired by music critics and served as influence to numerous K-pop and international artists.Despite their debut album, Bigbang Vol.1 (2006), receiving lukewarm reception, success followed with a string of notable hits credited to the quintet, including ""Lies"" (Korean: 거짓말), which topped major Korean music charts for a record-breaking six consecutive weeks and won Song of the Year at the 2007 Mnet Km Music Festival and the 2008 Seoul Music Awards; ""Last Farewell"" (Korean: 마지막 인사); ""Day by Day"" (Korean: 하루하루); and ""Sunset Glow"" (Korean: 붉은노을). After receiving the Artist of the Year award from the 2008 Mnet Korean Music Festival and the 2008 Seoul Music Awards, the group expanded their endeavors to Japan, releasing four studio albums, Big Bang (2009), Big Bang 2 (2011), Alive (2012), and Made Series (2016), which are all certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of Japan.
After a two-year hiatus in South Korea, the quintet produced increasingly innovative and critically acclaimed recordings. Their fourth EP, Tonight (2011), lead to their emergence as the inaugural Best Worldwide Act winner at the 2011 MTV Europe Music Awards. Their fifth EP, Alive (2012), became the first Korean album to chart on the Billboard 200. Their widely acclaimed third album, Made (2016), was preceded by several chart-topping singles, winning the group their third Artist of the Year award at the 2015 Mnet Asian Music Awards and their first at the 2015 Melon Music Awards. The supporting world tour gathered 1.5 million people in attendance, making it the most attended concert tour headlined by a Korean act in history.Big Bang has a record of 18 number-one songs that have collectively remained atop South Korean's biggest online music service Melon for 51 weeks, more than any other act. The quintet have sold over 140 million records and counting, making them one of the biggest-selling boy-bands in the world beating out American favorites like the Backstreet Boys and the Jackson Five. Forbes Korea ranked them as one of the most powerful celebrities in South Korea in 2010, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2016. They were also the first Korean artists to enter Forbes' Celebrity 100 and the 30 under 30 list of most influential musicians in the world, in 2016 and 2017, respectively.","['All articles with peacock terms', 'Articles containing Japanese-language text', 'Articles containing Korean-language text', 'Articles with Korean-language external links', 'Articles with hAudio microformats', 'Articles with hCards', 'Articles with peacock terms from April 2019', 'Articles with short description', 'Avex Group artists', 'Big Bang (South Korean band)', 'CS1 Chinese-language sources (zh)', 'CS1 Greek-language sources (el)', 'CS1 Japanese-language sources (ja)', 'CS1 Korean-language sources (ko)', 'CS1 Spanish-language sources (es)', 'CS1 Vietnamese-language sources (vi)', 'CS1 maint: BOT: original-url status unknown', 'CS1 uses Korean-language script (ko)', 'Commons category link is on Wikidata', 'Good articles', 'Grand Prize Golden Disc Award recipients', 'K-pop music groups', 'Korean Music Award winners', 'Melon Music Award winners', 'Mnet Asian Music Award winners', 'Musical groups established in 2006', 'Musical groups from Seoul', 'Musical quintets', 'Pages containing links to subscription-only content', 'South Korean boy bands', 'South Korean contemporary R&B musical groups', 'South Korean dance music groups', 'South Korean electronic musicians', 'South Korean hip hop groups', 'South Korean pop music groups', 'Universal Music Japan artists', 'Webarchive template wayback links', 'Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with MusicBrainz identifiers', 'Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages', 'YG Entertainment artists']","['Romance', 'Comedy', 'Youth']",Oksusu,This drama is about a young girl who meet up a world class superstar on the road one day.

1021,"Genre: Melodrama, Family","A melodrama is a dramatic work in which the plot, which is typically sensational and designed to appeal strongly to the emotions, takes precedence over detailed characterization. Characters are often simply drawn, and may appear stereotyped. Melodramas are typically set in the private sphere of the home, and focus on morality and family issues, love, and marriage, often with challenges from an outside source, such as a ""temptress”, an aristocratic villain.
In scholarly and historical musical contexts, melodramas are Victorian dramas in which orchestral music or song was used to accompany the action. The term is now also applied to stage performances without incidental music, novels, movies, television and radio broadcasts. In modern contexts, the term ""melodrama"" is generally pejorative, as it suggests that the work in question lacks subtlety, character development, or both. By extension, language or behaviour which resembles melodrama is often called melodramatic; this use is nearly always pejorative.","['19th-century theatre', 'All articles needing additional references', 'Articles needing additional references from July 2015', 'Articles with short description', 'Drama genres', 'Film genres', 'Melodramas', 'Opera terminology', 'Theatrical genres', 'Webarchive template wayback links', 'Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the 1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica with Wikisource reference']","['Melodrama', 'Family']",SBS,

1031,Last,"South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (ROK), is a country in East Asia, constituting the southern part of the Korean Peninsula and lying to the east of the Asian mainland. The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time, ruling most of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia, under Gwanggaeto the Great. South Korea lies in the north temperate zone and has a predominantly mountainous terrain. It comprises an estimated 51.4 million residents distributed over 100,363 km2 (38,750 sq mi). Its capital and largest city is Seoul, with a population of around 10 million.
Archaeology indicates that the Korean Peninsula was inhabited by early humans starting from the Lower Paleolithic period (2.6 Ma–300 Ka). The history of Korea begins with the foundation of Gojoseon in 2333 BCE by the mythic king Dangun, but no archaeological evidence and writing was found from this period. The Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in 11th century BCE, and its existence and role has been controversial in the modern era. The written historical record on Gojoseon (Old Joseon) was first mentioned in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under Unified Silla in CE 668, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910). It was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. At the end of World War II, Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S. zones of occupations. A separate election was held in the U.S. zone in 1948 which led to the creation of the Republic of Korea (ROK), while the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was established in the Soviet zone. The United Nations at the time passed a resolution declaring the ROK to be the only lawful government in Korea.The Korean War began in June 1950 when forces from North Korea invaded South Korea. The war lasted three years and involved the U.S., China, the Soviet Union and several other nations. The border between the two nations remains the most heavily fortified in the world. Under long-time military leader Park Chung-hee, the South Korean economy grew significantly and the country was transformed into a G-20 major economy. Military rule ended in 1987, and the country is now a presidential republic consisting of 17 administrative divisions.
South Korea is a highly developed country and a high-income economy, with a ""very high"" Human Development Index, ranking 22nd in the world. The country is considered a regional power and is the world's 11th largest economy by nominal GDP and the 12th largest by PPP as of 2010. South Korea is a global leader in the industrial and technological sectors, being the world's 5th largest exporter and 8th largest importer. Its export-driven economy primarily focuses production on electronics, automobiles, ships, machinery, petrochemicals and robotics. South Korea is a member of the ASEAN Plus mechanism, the United Nations, Uniting for Consensus, G20, the WTO and OECD and is a founding member of APEC and the East Asia Summit.","['1948 establishments in South Korea', 'All Wikipedia articles in need of updating', 'All articles containing potentially dated statements', 'All articles with dead external links', 'All articles with self-published sources', 'All articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Articles containing Korean-language text', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2005', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2010', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2016', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2018', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from May 2009', 'Articles with Curlie links', 'Articles with French-language external links', 'Articles with Korean-language external links', 'Articles with dead external links from April 2017', 'Articles with dead external links from February 2009', 'Articles with dead external links from July 2017', 'Articles with hAudio microformats', 'Articles with obsolete information from March 2012', 'Articles with permanently dead external links', 'Articles with self-published sources from December 2017', 'Articles with short description', 'Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from May 2012', 'Articles with unsourced statements from June 2018', 'CS1 Chinese-language sources (zh)', 'CS1 Korean-language sources (ko)', 'CS1 maint: BOT: original-url status unknown', 'CS1 uses Chinese-language script (zh)', 'CS1 uses Korean-language script (ko)', 'Coordinates on Wikidata', 'East Asian countries', 'G20 nations', 'Korea', 'Korean-speaking countries and territories', 'Member states of the United Nations', 'Northeast Asian countries', 'Official website different in Wikidata and Wikipedia', 'Pages using infobox country or infobox former country with the symbol caption or type parameters', 'Republics', 'South Korea', 'States and territories established in 1948', 'Use mdy dates from November 2017', 'Webarchive template wayback links', 'Webarchive template webcite links', 'Wikipedia articles incorporating text from the World Factbook', 'Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with MusicBrainz area identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with WorldCat-VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages']","['Crime', 'Action', 'Thriller']",jTBC,"This drama is based on the webcomic <em>“<a href=""http://webtoon.daum.net/webtoon/view/thelast"" target=""_blank"">라스트 / Last</a>“</em> by “<a href=""http://webtoon.daum.net/artist/total/257"" target=""_blank"">강형규 / Kang Hyung Kyu</a>” which was published from 2011-Feb-28 to 2012-Jan-23 via cartoon.media.daum.net.</p><p>The story centers on Jang Tae Ho (<a href=""http://star.koreandrama.org/yoon-kye-sang/"" target=""_blank"">Yoon Kye Sang</a>), who was once successful, but becomes homeless after failing at a stock operation involving an exorbitant amount in Korea’s stock market.

1052,Time of Miracle: Loss Time,"South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (ROK), is a country in East Asia, constituting the southern part of the Korean Peninsula and lying to the east of the Asian mainland. The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time, ruling most of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia, under Gwanggaeto the Great. South Korea lies in the north temperate zone and has a predominantly mountainous terrain. It comprises an estimated 51.4 million residents distributed over 100,363 km2 (38,750 sq mi). Its capital and largest city is Seoul, with a population of around 10 million.
Archaeology indicates that the Korean Peninsula was inhabited by early humans starting from the Lower Paleolithic period (2.6 Ma–300 Ka). The history of Korea begins with the foundation of Gojoseon in 2333 BCE by the mythic king Dangun, but no archaeological evidence and writing was found from this period. The Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in 11th century BCE, and its existence and role has been controversial in the modern era. The written historical record on Gojoseon (Old Joseon) was first mentioned in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under Unified Silla in CE 668, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910). It was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. At the end of World War II, Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S. zones of occupations. A separate election was held in the U.S. zone in 1948 which led to the creation of the Republic of Korea (ROK), while the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was established in the Soviet zone. The United Nations at the time passed a resolution declaring the ROK to be the only lawful government in Korea.The Korean War began in June 1950 when forces from North Korea invaded South Korea. The war lasted three years and involved the U.S., China, the Soviet Union and several other nations. The border between the two nations remains the most heavily fortified in the world. Under long-time military leader Park Chung-hee, the South Korean economy grew significantly and the country was transformed into a G-20 major economy. Military rule ended in 1987, and the country is now a presidential republic consisting of 17 administrative divisions.
South Korea is a highly developed country and a high-income economy, with a ""very high"" Human Development Index, ranking 22nd in the world. The country is considered a regional power and is the world's 11th largest economy by nominal GDP and the 12th largest by PPP as of 2010. South Korea is a global leader in the industrial and technological sectors, being the world's 5th largest exporter and 8th largest importer. Its export-driven economy primarily focuses production on electronics, automobiles, ships, machinery, petrochemicals and robotics. South Korea is a member of the ASEAN Plus mechanism, the United Nations, Uniting for Consensus, G20, the WTO and OECD and is a founding member of APEC and the East Asia Summit.","['1948 establishments in South Korea', 'All Wikipedia articles in need of updating', 'All articles containing potentially dated statements', 'All articles with dead external links', 'All articles with self-published sources', 'All articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Articles containing Korean-language text', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2005', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2010', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2016', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2018', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from May 2009', 'Articles with Curlie links', 'Articles with French-language external links', 'Articles with Korean-language external links', 'Articles with dead external links from April 2017', 'Articles with dead external links from February 2009', 'Articles with dead external links from July 2017', 'Articles with hAudio microformats', 'Articles with obsolete information from March 2012', 'Articles with permanently dead external links', 'Articles with self-published sources from December 2017', 'Articles with short description', 'Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from May 2012', 'Articles with unsourced statements from June 2018', 'CS1 Chinese-language sources (zh)', 'CS1 Korean-language sources (ko)', 'CS1 maint: BOT: original-url status unknown', 'CS1 uses Chinese-language script (zh)', 'CS1 uses Korean-language script (ko)', 'Coordinates on Wikidata', 'East Asian countries', 'G20 nations', 'Korea', 'Korean-speaking countries and territories', 'Member states of the United Nations', 'Northeast Asian countries', 'Official website different in Wikidata and Wikipedia', 'Pages using infobox country or infobox former country with the symbol caption or type parameters', 'Republics', 'South Korea', 'States and territories established in 1948', 'Use mdy dates from November 2017', 'Webarchive template wayback links', 'Webarchive template webcite links', 'Wikipedia articles incorporating text from the World Factbook', 'Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with MusicBrainz area identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with WorldCat-VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages']",['Comedy'],KBS2,A comedy about people who are facing sudden death but are given extra time to spend before death.

1064,Also known as: Beautiful Days,"South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (ROK), is a country in East Asia, constituting the southern part of the Korean Peninsula and lying to the east of the Asian mainland. The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time, ruling most of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia, under Gwanggaeto the Great. South Korea lies in the north temperate zone and has a predominantly mountainous terrain. It comprises an estimated 51.4 million residents distributed over 100,363 km2 (38,750 sq mi). Its capital and largest city is Seoul, with a population of around 10 million.
Archaeology indicates that the Korean Peninsula was inhabited by early humans starting from the Lower Paleolithic period (2.6 Ma–300 Ka). The history of Korea begins with the foundation of Gojoseon in 2333 BCE by the mythic king Dangun, but no archaeological evidence and writing was found from this period. The Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in 11th century BCE, and its existence and role has been controversial in the modern era. The written historical record on Gojoseon (Old Joseon) was first mentioned in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under Unified Silla in CE 668, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910). It was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. At the end of World War II, Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S. zones of occupations. A separate election was held in the U.S. zone in 1948 which led to the creation of the Republic of Korea (ROK), while the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was established in the Soviet zone. The United Nations at the time passed a resolution declaring the ROK to be the only lawful government in Korea.The Korean War began in June 1950 when forces from North Korea invaded South Korea. The war lasted three years and involved the U.S., China, the Soviet Union and several other nations. The border between the two nations remains the most heavily fortified in the world. Under long-time military leader Park Chung-hee, the South Korean economy grew significantly and the country was transformed into a G-20 major economy. Military rule ended in 1987, and the country is now a presidential republic consisting of 17 administrative divisions.
South Korea is a highly developed country and a high-income economy, with a ""very high"" Human Development Index, ranking 22nd in the world. The country is considered a regional power and is the world's 11th largest economy by nominal GDP and the 12th largest by PPP as of 2010. South Korea is a global leader in the industrial and technological sectors, being the world's 5th largest exporter and 8th largest importer. Its export-driven economy primarily focuses production on electronics, automobiles, ships, machinery, petrochemicals and robotics. South Korea is a member of the ASEAN Plus mechanism, the United Nations, Uniting for Consensus, G20, the WTO and OECD and is a founding member of APEC and the East Asia Summit.","['1948 establishments in South Korea', 'All Wikipedia articles in need of updating', 'All articles containing potentially dated statements', 'All articles with dead external links', 'All articles with self-published sources', 'All articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Articles containing Korean-language text', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2005', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2010', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2016', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2018', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from May 2009', 'Articles with Curlie links', 'Articles with French-language external links', 'Articles with Korean-language external links', 'Articles with dead external links from April 2017', 'Articles with dead external links from February 2009', 'Articles with dead external links from July 2017', 'Articles with hAudio microformats', 'Articles with obsolete information from March 2012', 'Articles with permanently dead external links', 'Articles with self-published sources from December 2017', 'Articles with short description', 'Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from May 2012', 'Articles with unsourced statements from June 2018', 'CS1 Chinese-language sources (zh)', 'CS1 Korean-language sources (ko)', 'CS1 maint: BOT: original-url status unknown', 'CS1 uses Chinese-language script (zh)', 'CS1 uses Korean-language script (ko)', 'Coordinates on Wikidata', 'East Asian countries', 'G20 nations', 'Korea', 'Korean-speaking countries and territories', 'Member states of the United Nations', 'Northeast Asian countries', 'Official website different in Wikidata and Wikipedia', 'Pages using infobox country or infobox former country with the symbol caption or type parameters', 'Republics', 'South Korea', 'States and territories established in 1948', 'Use mdy dates from November 2017', 'Webarchive template wayback links', 'Webarchive template webcite links', 'Wikipedia articles incorporating text from the World Factbook', 'Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with MusicBrainz area identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with WorldCat-VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages']",['Romance'],,

1067,Vacation,"Education in South Korea is provided by both public schools and private schools. Both types of schools receive funding from the government, although the amount that the private schools receive is less than the amount of the state schools. In recent years, Incheon Global Campus  (with start-up support) has kick-started, and Yonsei University opened an international college  to embrace the full English teaching environment scheme.
South Korea is one of the top-performing OECD countries in reading literacy, mathematics and sciences with the average student scoring 542. The country has one of the worlds highest-educated labour forces among OECD countries. The country is well known for its obsession with education, which has come to be called ""education fever"". The resource-poor nation is consistently ranked amongst the top for global education. In the 2014 national rankings of students’ math and science scores by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), South Korea ranked second place worldwide, after Singapore.Higher education is an overwhelmingly serious issue in South Korea society, where it is viewed as one of the fundamental cornerstones of South Korean life. Education is regarded with a high priority for South Korean families, as success in education is necessary for improving one's socioeconomic position in South Korean society. Academic success is often a source of pride for families and within South Korean society at large. South Koreans view education as the main propeller of social mobility for themselves and their family as a gateway to the South Korean middle class. Graduating from a top university is the ultimate marker of prestige, high socioeconomic status, promising marriage prospects, and a respectable career path. An average South Korean child's life revolves around education as pressure to succeed academically is deeply ingrained in South Korean children from an early age. Those who lack a formal university education often face social prejudice.In 2015, the country spent 4.7% of its GDP on all levels of education – roughly equal to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) average. A strong investment in education, a militant drive for success, as well as the passion for excellence has helped the resource poor country rapidly grow its economy over the past 60 years from a war-torn wasteland. South Korea’s zeal for education and its students’ desires to get into a prestigious university is one of the highest in the world, as the entrance into a top tier higher educational institution leads to a prestigious, secure and well-paid white collar job with the government, banks, a major South Korean conglomerate such as Samsung, Hyundai or LG Electronics. With incredible pressure on high school students to secure places at the nation’s best universities, its institutional reputation and alumni networks are strong predictors of future career prospects. The top three universities in South Korea, often referred to as ""SKY"", are Seoul National University, Korea University and Yonsei University. Intense competition and pressure to earn the highest grades is deeply ingrained in the psyche of South Korean students at a young age. Yet with only so many places at universities and even fewer places at top-tier companies, many young people remain disappointed and are often unwilling to lower their sights with the result of many feeling as underachievers. 
There is a major cultural taboo in South Korean society attached to those who have not achieved formal university education, where those who don't hold university degrees face social prejudice and are often looked down by others as second-class citizens, resulting fewer opportunities for employment, improvement of one's socioeconomic position and prospects for marriage.International reception on the South Korean education system has been divided. It has been praised for various reasons, including its comparatively high test results and its major role in ushering South Korea's economic development creating one of the world’s most educated workforces.
South Korea's highly enviable academic performance has gotten British education ministers actively remodeling their own curriculum's and exams to try to emulate Korea's militant drive and passion for excellence and high educational achievement. U.S. President Barack Obama has also praised the country's rigorous school system, where over 80 percent of South Korean high school graduates go on to university. The nation's high university entrance rate has created a highly skilled workforce making South Korea among the most highly educated countries in the world with the one of the highest percentage of its citizens holding a tertiary education degree. Bachelor's degrees are held by 68 percent of South Koreans aged 25–34, the most in the OECD.The system's rigid and hierarchical structure has been criticized for stifling creativity and innovation; described as intensely and ""brutally"" competitive, The system is often blamed for the high suicide rate in South Korea, particularly the growing rates among those aged 10–19. Various media outlets attribute the nations high suicide rate on the nationwide anxiety around the country's college entrance exams, which determine the trajectory of students' entire lives and careers.  Former South Korean hagwon teacher Se-Woong Koo wrote that the South Korean education system amounts to child abuse and that it should be ""reformed and restructured without delay."" The system has also been criticized for producing an excess supply of university graduates creating an overeducated and underemployed labor force; in the first quarter of 2013 alone, nearly 3.3 million South Korean university graduates were jobless, leading many graduates overqualified for jobs requiring less education. Further criticism has been stemmed for causing labor shortages in various skilled blue collar labor and vocational occupations, where many go unfilled as the negative social stigma associated with vocational careers and not having a university degree continues to remain deep-rooted in South Korean society.","['All articles needing additional references', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Articles containing Korean-language text', 'Articles needing additional references from July 2010', 'Articles with unsourced statements from April 2008', 'Articles with unsourced statements from August 2014', 'Articles with unsourced statements from February 2008', 'Articles with unsourced statements from January 2009', 'Articles with unsourced statements from June 2008', 'CS1 Korean-language sources (ko)', 'CS1 Spanish-language sources (es)', 'CS1 uses Korean-language script (ko)', 'Education in South Korea', 'Pages using deprecated image syntax', 'Pages with URL errors', 'Wikipedia articles needing clarification from September 2012']","['Romance', 'Drama', 'Comedy']",(Aired at Yunsae University Main Auditorium),The popular Kgroup DBSK (Dong Bang Shin Gi) was preparing for a concert…It’s been already 4 years since they debuted… During that time the members had stress piled up as well as disharmony between them.

1072,The End of the World,"South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (ROK), is a country in East Asia, constituting the southern part of the Korean Peninsula and lying to the east of the Asian mainland. The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time, ruling most of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia, under Gwanggaeto the Great. South Korea lies in the north temperate zone and has a predominantly mountainous terrain. It comprises an estimated 51.4 million residents distributed over 100,363 km2 (38,750 sq mi). Its capital and largest city is Seoul, with a population of around 10 million.
Archaeology indicates that the Korean Peninsula was inhabited by early humans starting from the Lower Paleolithic period (2.6 Ma–300 Ka). The history of Korea begins with the foundation of Gojoseon in 2333 BCE by the mythic king Dangun, but no archaeological evidence and writing was found from this period. The Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in 11th century BCE, and its existence and role has been controversial in the modern era. The written historical record on Gojoseon (Old Joseon) was first mentioned in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under Unified Silla in CE 668, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910). It was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. At the end of World War II, Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S. zones of occupations. A separate election was held in the U.S. zone in 1948 which led to the creation of the Republic of Korea (ROK), while the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was established in the Soviet zone. The United Nations at the time passed a resolution declaring the ROK to be the only lawful government in Korea.The Korean War began in June 1950 when forces from North Korea invaded South Korea. The war lasted three years and involved the U.S., China, the Soviet Union and several other nations. The border between the two nations remains the most heavily fortified in the world. Under long-time military leader Park Chung-hee, the South Korean economy grew significantly and the country was transformed into a G-20 major economy. Military rule ended in 1987, and the country is now a presidential republic consisting of 17 administrative divisions.
South Korea is a highly developed country and a high-income economy, with a ""very high"" Human Development Index, ranking 22nd in the world. The country is considered a regional power and is the world's 11th largest economy by nominal GDP and the 12th largest by PPP as of 2010. South Korea is a global leader in the industrial and technological sectors, being the world's 5th largest exporter and 8th largest importer. Its export-driven economy primarily focuses production on electronics, automobiles, ships, machinery, petrochemicals and robotics. South Korea is a member of the ASEAN Plus mechanism, the United Nations, Uniting for Consensus, G20, the WTO and OECD and is a founding member of APEC and the East Asia Summit.","['1948 establishments in South Korea', 'All Wikipedia articles in need of updating', 'All articles containing potentially dated statements', 'All articles with dead external links', 'All articles with self-published sources', 'All articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Articles containing Korean-language text', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2005', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2010', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2016', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2018', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from May 2009', 'Articles with Curlie links', 'Articles with French-language external links', 'Articles with Korean-language external links', 'Articles with dead external links from April 2017', 'Articles with dead external links from February 2009', 'Articles with dead external links from July 2017', 'Articles with hAudio microformats', 'Articles with obsolete information from March 2012', 'Articles with permanently dead external links', 'Articles with self-published sources from December 2017', 'Articles with short description', 'Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from May 2012', 'Articles with unsourced statements from June 2018', 'CS1 Chinese-language sources (zh)', 'CS1 Korean-language sources (ko)', 'CS1 maint: BOT: original-url status unknown', 'CS1 uses Chinese-language script (zh)', 'CS1 uses Korean-language script (ko)', 'Coordinates on Wikidata', 'East Asian countries', 'G20 nations', 'Korea', 'Korean-speaking countries and territories', 'Member states of the United Nations', 'Northeast Asian countries', 'Official website different in Wikidata and Wikipedia', 'Pages using infobox country or infobox former country with the symbol caption or type parameters', 'Republics', 'South Korea', 'States and territories established in 1948', 'Use mdy dates from November 2017', 'Webarchive template wayback links', 'Webarchive template webcite links', 'Wikipedia articles incorporating text from the World Factbook', 'Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with MusicBrainz area identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with WorldCat-VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages']","['Medical', 'Mystery', 'Romance']",jTBC,"This is a drama about a unknown mysterious disease spreads.</p><p>Kang Joo Hun (<a href=""http://star.koreandrama.org/?p=9232"" target=""_blank"">Yoon Je Moon</a>) is the chief of epidemiological investigation at the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

1083,The Disappearance of the Member of Parliament,"North Korea, officially the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK or DPR Korea) (Korean: 조선민주주의인민공화국, Chosŏn Minjujuŭi Inmin Konghwaguk), is a country in East Asia constituting the northern part of the Korean Peninsula, with Pyongyang the capital and the largest city in the country. The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time, ruling most of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia, under Gwanggaeto the Great. To the north and northwest, the country is bordered by China and by Russia along the Amnok (known as the Yalu in Chinese) and Tumen rivers; it is bordered to the south by South Korea, with the heavily fortified Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) separating the two. Nevertheless, North Korea, like its southern counterpart, claims to be the legitimate government of the entire peninsula and adjacent islands.In 1910, Korea was annexed by Imperial Japan. After the Japanese surrender at the end of World War II in 1945, Korea was divided into two zones, with the north occupied by the Soviet Union and the south occupied by the United States. Negotiations on reunification failed, and in 1948, separate governments were formed: the socialist Democratic People's Republic of Korea in the north, and the capitalist Republic of Korea in the south. An invasion initiated by North Korea led to the Korean War (1950–1953). The Korean Armistice Agreement brought about a ceasefire, but no peace treaty was signed.North Korea officially describes itself as a ""self-reliant"" socialist state, and formally holds elections, though said elections have been described by outside observers as sham elections. Outside observers also generally view North Korea as a Stalinist totalitarian dictatorship, particularly noting the elaborate cult of personality around Kim Il-sung and his family. The Workers' Party of Korea (WPK), led by a member of the ruling family, holds power in the state and leads the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland of which all political officers are required to be members. Juche, an ideology of national self-reliance, was introduced into the constitution in 1972. The means of production are owned by the state through state-run enterprises and collectivized farms. Most services such as healthcare, education, housing and food production are subsidized or state-funded. From 1994 to 1998, North Korea suffered a famine that resulted in the deaths of between 240,000 and 420,000 people, and the population continues to suffer malnutrition. North Korea follows Songun, or ""military-first"" policy. It is the country with the highest number of military and paramilitary personnel, with a total of 9,495,000 active, reserve and paramilitary personnel, or approximately 37% of its population.  Its active duty army of 1.21 million is the fourth largest in the world, after China, the United States and India; consisting of 4.8% of its population.  It possesses nuclear weapons.The UN inquiry into human rights in North Korea concluded that, ""The gravity, scale and nature of these violations reveal a state that does not have any parallel in the contemporary world"". The North Korean regime strongly denies most allegations, accusing international organizations of fabricating human rights abuses as part of a smear campaign with the covert intention of undermining the state, although they admit that there are human rights issues relating to living conditions which the regime is attempting to correct.In addition to being a member of the United Nations since 1991, the sovereign state is also a member of the Non-Aligned Movement, G77 and the ASEAN Regional Forum.","['1948 establishments in North Korea', 'All Wikipedia articles in need of updating', 'All articles containing potentially dated statements', 'All articles that may contain original research', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Articles containing Korean-language text', 'Articles containing explicitly cited English-language text', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2015', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from August 2017', 'Articles that may contain original research from August 2016', 'Articles with Curlie links', 'Articles with hAudio microformats', 'Articles with short description', 'Articles with unsourced statements from February 2018', 'Articles with unsourced statements from March 2018', 'Atheist states', 'CS1 Chinese-language sources (zh)', 'CS1 French-language sources (fr)', 'CS1 Korean-language sources (ko)', 'CS1 maint: BOT: original-url status unknown', 'CS1 uses Chinese-language script (zh)', 'CS1 uses Korean-language script (ko)', 'Communist states', 'Coordinates on Wikidata', 'East Asian countries', 'Korea', 'Korean-speaking countries and territories', 'Member states of the United Nations', 'North Korea', 'Northeast Asian countries', 'Pages using infobox country or infobox former country with the symbol caption or type parameters', 'Republics', 'States and territories established in 1948', 'Totalitarian states', 'Use dmy dates from May 2017', 'Webarchive template wayback links', 'Wikipedia articles in need of updating from February 2018', 'Wikipedia articles in need of updating from June 2017', 'Wikipedia articles needing page number citations from February 2016', 'Wikipedia articles needing page number citations from July 2015', 'Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with MusicBrainz area identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with WorldCat-VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia indefinitely move-protected pages', 'Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages']",['Comedy'],KBS2,"A drama about Jeong Chi Seong (<a href=""http://star.koreandrama.org/?p=1266"" target=""_blank"">Yoo Oh Sung</a>), a former prosecuter and current third line mid-level member of Parliament who gets abandoned in an island."

With the onset of the Cold War, negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union failed to lead to an independent and unified Korea. In 1948, UN-supervised elections were held in the US-occupied south only. Syngman Rhee won the election while Kim Il-sung was appointed as the leader of North Korea. This led to the establishment of the Republic of Korea in South Korea, which was promptly followed by the establishment of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in North Korea. The United States supported the South, the Soviet Union supported the North, and each government claimed sovereignty over the whole Korean peninsula.
In 1950, North Korea invaded the South to try to reunify the peninsula under its communist rule. The subsequent Korean War, which lasted from 1950 to 1953, ended with a stalemate and has left the two Koreas separated by the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) up to the present day.

1092,A Man’s Story,"South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (ROK), is a country in East Asia, constituting the southern part of the Korean Peninsula and lying to the east of the Asian mainland. The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time, ruling most of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia, under Gwanggaeto the Great. South Korea lies in the north temperate zone and has a predominantly mountainous terrain. It comprises an estimated 51.4 million residents distributed over 100,363 km2 (38,750 sq mi). Its capital and largest city is Seoul, with a population of around 10 million.
Archaeology indicates that the Korean Peninsula was inhabited by early humans starting from the Lower Paleolithic period (2.6 Ma–300 Ka). The history of Korea begins with the foundation of Gojoseon in 2333 BCE by the mythic king Dangun, but no archaeological evidence and writing was found from this period. The Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in 11th century BCE, and its existence and role has been controversial in the modern era. The written historical record on Gojoseon (Old Joseon) was first mentioned in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under Unified Silla in CE 668, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910). It was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. At the end of World War II, Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S. zones of occupations. A separate election was held in the U.S. zone in 1948 which led to the creation of the Republic of Korea (ROK), while the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was established in the Soviet zone. The United Nations at the time passed a resolution declaring the ROK to be the only lawful government in Korea.The Korean War began in June 1950 when forces from North Korea invaded South Korea. The war lasted three years and involved the U.S., China, the Soviet Union and several other nations. The border between the two nations remains the most heavily fortified in the world. Under long-time military leader Park Chung-hee, the South Korean economy grew significantly and the country was transformed into a G-20 major economy. Military rule ended in 1987, and the country is now a presidential republic consisting of 17 administrative divisions.
South Korea is a highly developed country and a high-income economy, with a ""very high"" Human Development Index, ranking 22nd in the world. The country is considered a regional power and is the world's 11th largest economy by nominal GDP and the 12th largest by PPP as of 2010. South Korea is a global leader in the industrial and technological sectors, being the world's 5th largest exporter and 8th largest importer. Its export-driven economy primarily focuses production on electronics, automobiles, ships, machinery, petrochemicals and robotics. South Korea is a member of the ASEAN Plus mechanism, the United Nations, Uniting for Consensus, G20, the WTO and OECD and is a founding member of APEC and the East Asia Summit.","['1948 establishments in South Korea', 'All Wikipedia articles in need of updating', 'All articles containing potentially dated statements', 'All articles with dead external links', 'All articles with self-published sources', 'All articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Articles containing Korean-language text', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2005', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2010', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2016', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2018', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from May 2009', 'Articles with Curlie links', 'Articles with French-language external links', 'Articles with Korean-language external links', 'Articles with dead external links from April 2017', 'Articles with dead external links from February 2009', 'Articles with dead external links from July 2017', 'Articles with hAudio microformats', 'Articles with obsolete information from March 2012', 'Articles with permanently dead external links', 'Articles with self-published sources from December 2017', 'Articles with short description', 'Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from May 2012', 'Articles with unsourced statements from June 2018', 'CS1 Chinese-language sources (zh)', 'CS1 Korean-language sources (ko)', 'CS1 maint: BOT: original-url status unknown', 'CS1 uses Chinese-language script (zh)', 'CS1 uses Korean-language script (ko)', 'Coordinates on Wikidata', 'East Asian countries', 'G20 nations', 'Korea', 'Korean-speaking countries and territories', 'Member states of the United Nations', 'Northeast Asian countries', 'Official website different in Wikidata and Wikipedia', 'Pages using infobox country or infobox former country with the symbol caption or type parameters', 'Republics', 'South Korea', 'States and territories established in 1948', 'Use mdy dates from November 2017', 'Webarchive template wayback links', 'Webarchive template webcite links', 'Wikipedia articles incorporating text from the World Factbook', 'Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with MusicBrainz area identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with WorldCat-VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages']","['Action', 'romance']",KBS2,

1107,Big Heat,"South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (ROK), is a country in East Asia, constituting the southern part of the Korean Peninsula and lying to the east of the Asian mainland. The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time, ruling most of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia, under Gwanggaeto the Great. South Korea lies in the north temperate zone and has a predominantly mountainous terrain. It comprises an estimated 51.4 million residents distributed over 100,363 km2 (38,750 sq mi). Its capital and largest city is Seoul, with a population of around 10 million.
Archaeology indicates that the Korean Peninsula was inhabited by early humans starting from the Lower Paleolithic period (2.6 Ma–300 Ka). The history of Korea begins with the foundation of Gojoseon in 2333 BCE by the mythic king Dangun, but no archaeological evidence and writing was found from this period. The Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in 11th century BCE, and its existence and role has been controversial in the modern era. The written historical record on Gojoseon (Old Joseon) was first mentioned in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under Unified Silla in CE 668, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910). It was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. At the end of World War II, Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S. zones of occupations. A separate election was held in the U.S. zone in 1948 which led to the creation of the Republic of Korea (ROK), while the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was established in the Soviet zone. The United Nations at the time passed a resolution declaring the ROK to be the only lawful government in Korea.The Korean War began in June 1950 when forces from North Korea invaded South Korea. The war lasted three years and involved the U.S., China, the Soviet Union and several other nations. The border between the two nations remains the most heavily fortified in the world. Under long-time military leader Park Chung-hee, the South Korean economy grew significantly and the country was transformed into a G-20 major economy. Military rule ended in 1987, and the country is now a presidential republic consisting of 17 administrative divisions.
South Korea is a highly developed country and a high-income economy, with a ""very high"" Human Development Index, ranking 22nd in the world. The country is considered a regional power and is the world's 11th largest economy by nominal GDP and the 12th largest by PPP as of 2010. South Korea is a global leader in the industrial and technological sectors, being the world's 5th largest exporter and 8th largest importer. Its export-driven economy primarily focuses production on electronics, automobiles, ships, machinery, petrochemicals and robotics. South Korea is a member of the ASEAN Plus mechanism, the United Nations, Uniting for Consensus, G20, the WTO and OECD and is a founding member of APEC and the East Asia Summit.","['1948 establishments in South Korea', 'All Wikipedia articles in need of updating', 'All articles containing potentially dated statements', 'All articles with dead external links', 'All articles with self-published sources', 'All articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Articles containing Korean-language text', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2005', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2010', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2016', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2018', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from May 2009', 'Articles with Curlie links', 'Articles with French-language external links', 'Articles with Korean-language external links', 'Articles with dead external links from April 2017', 'Articles with dead external links from February 2009', 'Articles with dead external links from July 2017', 'Articles with hAudio microformats', 'Articles with obsolete information from March 2012', 'Articles with permanently dead external links', 'Articles with self-published sources from December 2017', 'Articles with short description', 'Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from May 2012', 'Articles with unsourced statements from June 2018', 'CS1 Chinese-language sources (zh)', 'CS1 Korean-language sources (ko)', 'CS1 maint: BOT: original-url status unknown', 'CS1 uses Chinese-language script (zh)', 'CS1 uses Korean-language script (ko)', 'Coordinates on Wikidata', 'East Asian countries', 'G20 nations', 'Korea', 'Korean-speaking countries and territories', 'Member states of the United Nations', 'Northeast Asian countries', 'Official website different in Wikidata and Wikipedia', 'Pages using infobox country or infobox former country with the symbol caption or type parameters', 'Republics', 'South Korea', 'States and territories established in 1948', 'Use mdy dates from November 2017', 'Webarchive template wayback links', 'Webarchive template webcite links', 'Wikipedia articles incorporating text from the World Factbook', 'Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with MusicBrainz area identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with WorldCat-VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages']","['Drama', 'music']",,"Big Heat is a rookie idol group comprised of four youngsters who have all suffered various grievances at the hands of society, but have managed to find the determination to transcend this to achieve their dreams.

1122,Praise of Death,"South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (ROK), is a country in East Asia, constituting the southern part of the Korean Peninsula and lying to the east of the Asian mainland. The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time, ruling most of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia, under Gwanggaeto the Great. South Korea lies in the north temperate zone and has a predominantly mountainous terrain. It comprises an estimated 51.4 million residents distributed over 100,363 km2 (38,750 sq mi). Its capital and largest city is Seoul, with a population of around 10 million.
Archaeology indicates that the Korean Peninsula was inhabited by early humans starting from the Lower Paleolithic period (2.6 Ma–300 Ka). The history of Korea begins with the foundation of Gojoseon in 2333 BCE by the mythic king Dangun, but no archaeological evidence and writing was found from this period. The Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in 11th century BCE, and its existence and role has been controversial in the modern era. The written historical record on Gojoseon (Old Joseon) was first mentioned in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under Unified Silla in CE 668, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910). It was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. At the end of World War II, Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S. zones of occupations. A separate election was held in the U.S. zone in 1948 which led to the creation of the Republic of Korea (ROK), while the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was established in the Soviet zone. The United Nations at the time passed a resolution declaring the ROK to be the only lawful government in Korea.The Korean War began in June 1950 when forces from North Korea invaded South Korea. The war lasted three years and involved the U.S., China, the Soviet Union and several other nations. The border between the two nations remains the most heavily fortified in the world. Under long-time military leader Park Chung-hee, the South Korean economy grew significantly and the country was transformed into a G-20 major economy. Military rule ended in 1987, and the country is now a presidential republic consisting of 17 administrative divisions.
South Korea is a highly developed country and a high-income economy, with a ""very high"" Human Development Index, ranking 22nd in the world. The country is considered a regional power and is the world's 11th largest economy by nominal GDP and the 12th largest by PPP as of 2010.

1125,Brain,"Education in South Korea is provided by both public schools and private schools. Both types of schools receive funding from the government, although the amount that the private schools receive is less than the amount of the state schools. In recent years, Incheon Global Campus  (with start-up support) has kick-started, and Yonsei University opened an international college  to embrace the full English teaching environment scheme.
South Korea is one of the top-performing OECD countries in reading literacy, mathematics and sciences with the average student scoring 542. The country has one of the worlds highest-educated labour forces among OECD countries. The country is well known for its obsession with education, which has come to be called ""education fever"". The resource-poor nation is consistently ranked amongst the top for global education. In the 2014 national rankings of students’ math and science scores by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), South Korea ranked second place worldwide, after Singapore.Higher education is an overwhelmingly serious issue in South Korea society, where it is viewed as one of the fundamental cornerstones of South Korean life. Education is regarded with a high priority for South Korean families, as success in education is necessary for improving one's socioeconomic position in South Korean society. Academic success is often a source of pride for families and within South Korean society at large. South Koreans view education as the main propeller of social mobility for themselves and their family as a gateway to the South Korean middle class. Graduating from a top university is the ultimate marker of prestige, high socioeconomic status, promising marriage prospects, and a respectable career path. An average South Korean child's life revolves around education as pressure to succeed academically is deeply ingrained in South Korean children from an early age. Those who lack a formal university education often face social prejudice.In 2015, the country spent 4.7% of its GDP on all levels of education – roughly equal to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) average. A strong investment in education, a militant drive for success, as well as the passion for excellence has helped the resource poor country rapidly grow its economy over the past 60 years from a war-torn wasteland. South Korea’s zeal for education and its students’ desires to get into a prestigious university is one of the highest in the world, as the entrance into a top tier higher educational institution leads to a prestigious, secure and well-paid white collar job with the government, banks, a major South Korean conglomerate such as Samsung, Hyundai or LG Electronics. With incredible pressure on high school students to secure places at the nation’s best universities, its institutional reputation and alumni networks are strong predictors of future career prospects. The top three universities in South Korea, often referred to as ""SKY"", are Seoul National University, Korea University and Yonsei University. Intense competition and pressure to earn the highest grades is deeply ingrained in the psyche of South Korean students at a young age. Yet with only so many places at universities and even fewer places at top-tier companies, many young people remain disappointed and are often unwilling to lower their sights with the result of many feeling as underachievers. 
There is a major cultural taboo in South Korean society attached to those who have not achieved formal university education, where those who don't hold university degrees face social prejudice and are often looked down by others as second-class citizens, resulting fewer opportunities for employment, improvement of one's socioeconomic position and prospects for marriage.International reception on the South Korean education system has been divided. It has been praised for various reasons, including its comparatively high test results and its major role in ushering South Korea's economic development creating one of the world’s most educated workforces.
South Korea's highly enviable academic performance has gotten British education ministers actively remodeling their own curriculum's and exams to try to emulate Korea's militant drive and passion for excellence and high educational achievement. U.S. President Barack Obama has also praised the country's rigorous school system, where over 80 percent of South Korean high school graduates go on to university. The nation's high university entrance rate has created a highly skilled workforce making South Korea among the most highly educated countries in the world with the one of the highest percentage of its citizens holding a tertiary education degree. Bachelor's degrees are held by 68 percent of South Koreans aged 25–34, the most in the OECD.The system's rigid and hierarchical structure has been criticized for stifling creativity and innovation; described as intensely and ""brutally"" competitive, The system is often blamed for the high suicide rate in South Korea, particularly the growing rates among those aged 10–19. Various media outlets attribute the nations high suicide rate on the nationwide anxiety around the country's college entrance exams, which determine the trajectory of students' entire lives and careers.  Former South Korean hagwon teacher Se-Woong Koo wrote that the South Korean education system amounts to child abuse and that it should be ""reformed and restructured without delay."" The system has also been criticized for producing an excess supply of university graduates creating an overeducated and underemployed labor force; in the first quarter of 2013 alone, nearly 3.3 million South Korean university graduates were jobless, leading many graduates overqualified for jobs requiring less education. Further criticism has been stemmed for causing labor shortages in various skilled blue collar labor and vocational occupations, where many go unfilled as the negative social stigma associated with vocational careers and not having a university degree continues to remain deep-rooted in South Korean society.","['All articles needing additional references', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Articles containing Korean-language text', 'Articles needing additional references from July 2010', 'Articles with unsourced statements from April 2008', 'Articles with unsourced statements from August 2014', 'Articles with unsourced statements from February 2008', 'Articles with unsourced statements from January 2009', 'Articles with unsourced statements from June 2008', 'CS1 Korean-language sources (ko)', 'CS1 Spanish-language sources (es)', 'CS1 uses Korean-language script (ko)', 'Education in South Korea', 'Pages using deprecated image syntax', 'Pages with URL errors', 'Wikipedia articles needing clarification from September 2012']",['MedicalDrama'],KBS2,"A drama that deals with the brain and neurosurgeons.</p><p>Lee Kang Hoon (<a href=""http://star.koreandrama.org/?p=28"" target=""_blank"">Shin Ha Kyun</a>), who graduated from the top medical school, works at the top hospital, and is the top neurosurgeon around.

The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time, ruling most of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia, under Gwanggaeto the Great. South Korea lies in the north temperate zone and has a predominantly mountainous terrain. It comprises an estimated 51.4 million residents distributed over 100,363 km2 (38,750 sq mi). Its capital and largest city is Seoul, with a population of around 10 million.
Archaeology indicates that the Korean Peninsula was inhabited by early humans starting from the Lower Paleolithic period (2.6 Ma–300 Ka). The history of Korea begins with the foundation of Gojoseon in 2333 BCE by the mythic king Dangun, but no archaeological evidence and writing was found from this period. The Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in 11th century BCE, and its existence and role has been controversial in the modern era. The written historical record on Gojoseon (Old Joseon) was first mentioned in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under Unified Silla in CE 668, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910). It was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. At the end of World War II, Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S. zones of occupations. A separate election was held in the U.S. zone in 1948 which led to the creation of the Republic of Korea (ROK), while the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was established in the Soviet zone. The United Nations at the time passed a resolution declaring the ROK to be the only lawful government in Korea.The Korean War began in June 1950 when forces from North Korea invaded South Korea. The war lasted three years and involved the U.S., China, the Soviet Union and several other nations. The border between the two nations remains the most heavily fortified in the world.

1137,3 Days,"South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (ROK), is a country in East Asia, constituting the southern part of the Korean Peninsula and lying to the east of the Asian mainland. The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time, ruling most of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia, under Gwanggaeto the Great. South Korea lies in the north temperate zone and has a predominantly mountainous terrain. It comprises an estimated 51.4 million residents distributed over 100,363 km2 (38,750 sq mi). Its capital and largest city is Seoul, with a population of around 10 million.
Archaeology indicates that the Korean Peninsula was inhabited by early humans starting from the Lower Paleolithic period (2.6 Ma–300 Ka). The history of Korea begins with the foundation of Gojoseon in 2333 BCE by the mythic king Dangun, but no archaeological evidence and writing was found from this period. The Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in 11th century BCE, and its existence and role has been controversial in the modern era. The written historical record on Gojoseon (Old Joseon) was first mentioned in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under Unified Silla in CE 668, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910). It was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. At the end of World War II, Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S. zones of occupations. A separate election was held in the U.S. zone in 1948 which led to the creation of the Republic of Korea (ROK), while the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was established in the Soviet zone. The United Nations at the time passed a resolution declaring the ROK to be the only lawful government in Korea.The Korean War began in June 1950 when forces from North Korea invaded South Korea. The war lasted three years and involved the U.S., China, the Soviet Union and several other nations. The border between the two nations remains the most heavily fortified in the world. Under long-time military leader Park Chung-hee, the South Korean economy grew significantly and the country was transformed into a G-20 major economy. Military rule ended in 1987, and the country is now a presidential republic consisting of 17 administrative divisions.
South Korea is a highly developed country and a high-income economy, with a ""very high"" Human Development Index, ranking 22nd in the world. The country is considered a regional power and is the world's 11th largest economy by nominal GDP and the 12th largest by PPP as of 2010. South Korea is a global leader in the industrial and technological sectors, being the world's 5th largest exporter and 8th largest importer. Its export-driven economy primarily focuses production on electronics, automobiles, ships, machinery, petrochemicals and robotics. South Korea is a member of the ASEAN Plus mechanism, the United Nations, Uniting for Consensus, G20, the WTO and OECD and is a founding member of APEC and the East Asia Summit.","['1948 establishments in South Korea', 'All Wikipedia articles in need of updating', 'All articles containing potentially dated statements', 'All articles with dead external links', 'All articles with self-published sources', 'All articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Articles containing Korean-language text', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2005', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2010', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2016', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2018', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from May 2009', 'Articles with Curlie links', 'Articles with French-language external links', 'Articles with Korean-language external links', 'Articles with dead external links from April 2017', 'Articles with dead external links from February 2009', 'Articles with dead external links from July 2017', 'Articles with hAudio microformats', 'Articles with obsolete information from March 2012', 'Articles with permanently dead external links', 'Articles with self-published sources from December 2017', 'Articles with short description', 'Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from May 2012', 'Articles with unsourced statements from June 2018', 'CS1 Chinese-language sources (zh)', 'CS1 Korean-language sources (ko)', 'CS1 maint: BOT: original-url status unknown', 'CS1 uses Chinese-language script (zh)', 'CS1 uses Korean-language script (ko)', 'Coordinates on Wikidata', 'East Asian countries', 'G20 nations', 'Korea', 'Korean-speaking countries and territories', 'Member states of the United Nations', 'Northeast Asian countries', 'Official website different in Wikidata and Wikipedia', 'Pages using infobox country or infobox former country with the symbol caption or type parameters', 'Republics', 'South Korea', 'States and territories established in 1948', 'Use mdy dates from November 2017', 'Webarchive template wayback links', 'Webarchive template webcite links', 'Wikipedia articles incorporating text from the World Factbook', 'Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with MusicBrainz area identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with WorldCat-VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages']","['Melodrama', 'Action', 'Crime', 'Thriller', 'Political', 'Romance']",SBS,

1168,9 Seconds – Eternal Time,"Time is the indefinite continued progress of existence and events that occur in apparently irreversible succession through the past, in the present, and the future. Time is a component quantity of various measurements used to sequence events, to compare the duration of events or the intervals between them, and to quantify rates of change of quantities in material reality or in the conscious experience. Time is often referred to as a fourth dimension, along with three spatial dimensions.Time has long been an important subject of study in religion, philosophy, and science, but defining it in a manner applicable to all fields without circularity has consistently eluded scholars.
Nevertheless, diverse fields such as business, industry, sports, the sciences, and the performing arts all incorporate some notion of time into their respective measuring systems.Time in physics is unambiguously operationally defined as ""what a clock reads"". See Units of Time. Time is one of the seven fundamental physical quantities in both the International System of Units and International System of Quantities. Time is used to define other quantities – such as velocity – so defining time in terms of such quantities would result in circularity of definition. An operational definition of time, wherein one says that observing a certain number of repetitions of one or another standard cyclical event (such as the passage of a free-swinging pendulum) constitutes one standard unit such as the second, is highly useful in the conduct of both advanced experiments and everyday affairs of life. The operational definition leaves aside the question whether there is something called time, apart from the counting activity just mentioned, that flows and that can be measured. Investigations of a single continuum called spacetime bring questions about space into questions about time, questions that have their roots in the works of early students of natural philosophy.
Temporal measurement has occupied scientists and technologists, and was a prime motivation in navigation and astronomy. Periodic events and periodic motion have long served as standards for units of time. Examples include the apparent motion of the sun across the sky, the phases of the moon, the swing of a pendulum, and the beat of a heart. Currently, the international unit of time, the second, is defined by measuring the electronic transition frequency of caesium atoms (see below). Time is also of significant social importance, having economic value (""time is money"") as well as personal value, due to an awareness of the limited time in each day and in human life spans.","['All articles containing potentially dated statements', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from May 2010', 'Articles with inconsistent citation formats', 'Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from August 2015', 'Articles with unsourced statements from August 2015', 'Articles with unsourced statements from January 2015', 'CS1: long volume value', 'CS1 errors: dates', 'CS1 maint: Multiple names: authors list', 'Concepts in metaphysics', 'Concepts in physics', 'Physical quantities', 'SI base quantities', 'Spacetime', 'Time', 'UCUM base quantities', 'Use dmy dates from November 2012', 'Webarchive template wayback links', 'Wikipedia articles needing clarification from February 2014', 'Wikipedia articles needing page number citations from October 2018', 'Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers', 'Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages']","['Romance', 'Melodrama']",NAVER tvcast,

1170,King’s Family,"South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (ROK), is a country in East Asia, constituting the southern part of the Korean Peninsula and lying to the east of the Asian mainland. The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time, ruling most of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia, under Gwanggaeto the Great. South Korea lies in the north temperate zone and has a predominantly mountainous terrain. It comprises an estimated 51.4 million residents distributed over 100,363 km2 (38,750 sq mi). Its capital and largest city is Seoul, with a population of around 10 million.
Archaeology indicates that the Korean Peninsula was inhabited by early humans starting from the Lower Paleolithic period (2.6 Ma–300 Ka). The history of Korea begins with the foundation of Gojoseon in 2333 BCE by the mythic king Dangun, but no archaeological evidence and writing was found from this period. The Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in 11th century BCE, and its existence and role has been controversial in the modern era. The written historical record on Gojoseon (Old Joseon) was first mentioned in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under Unified Silla in CE 668, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910). It was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. At the end of World War II, Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S. zones of occupations. A separate election was held in the U.S. zone in 1948 which led to the creation of the Republic of Korea (ROK), while the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was established in the Soviet zone. The United Nations at the time passed a resolution declaring the ROK to be the only lawful government in Korea.The Korean War began in June 1950 when forces from North Korea invaded South Korea. The war lasted three years and involved the U.S., China, the Soviet Union and several other nations. The border between the two nations remains the most heavily fortified in the world. Under long-time military leader Park Chung-hee, the South Korean economy grew significantly and the country was transformed into a G-20 major economy. Military rule ended in 1987, and the country is now a presidential republic consisting of 17 administrative divisions.
South Korea is a highly developed country and a high-income economy, with a ""very high"" Human Development Index, ranking 22nd in the world. The country is considered a regional power and is the world's 11th largest economy by nominal GDP and the 12th largest by PPP as of 2010. South Korea is a global leader in the industrial and technological sectors, being the world's 5th largest exporter and 8th largest importer. Its export-driven economy primarily focuses production on electronics, automobiles, ships, machinery, petrochemicals and robotics. South Korea is a member of the ASEAN Plus mechanism, the United Nations, Uniting for Consensus, G20, the WTO and OECD and is a founding member of APEC and the East Asia Summit.","['1948 establishments in South Korea', 'All Wikipedia articles in need of updating', 'All articles containing potentially dated statements', 'All articles with dead external links', 'All articles with self-published sources', 'All articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Articles containing Korean-language text', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2005', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2010', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2016', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2018', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from May 2009', 'Articles with Curlie links', 'Articles with French-language external links', 'Articles with Korean-language external links', 'Articles with dead external links from April 2017', 'Articles with dead external links from February 2009', 'Articles with dead external links from July 2017', 'Articles with hAudio microformats', 'Articles with obsolete information from March 2012', 'Articles with permanently dead external links', 'Articles with self-published sources from December 2017', 'Articles with short description', 'Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from May 2012', 'Articles with unsourced statements from June 2018', 'CS1 Chinese-language sources (zh)', 'CS1 Korean-language sources (ko)', 'CS1 maint: BOT: original-url status unknown', 'CS1 uses Chinese-language script (zh)', 'CS1 uses Korean-language script (ko)', 'Coordinates on Wikidata', 'East Asian countries', 'G20 nations', 'Korea', 'Korean-speaking countries and territories', 'Member states of the United Nations', 'Northeast Asian countries', 'Official website different in Wikidata and Wikipedia', 'Pages using infobox country or infobox former country with the symbol caption or type parameters', 'Republics', 'South Korea', 'States and territories established in 1948', 'Use mdy dates from November 2017', 'Webarchive template wayback links', 'Webarchive template webcite links', 'Wikipedia articles incorporating text from the World Factbook', 'Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with MusicBrainz area identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with WorldCat-VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages']","['Family', 'Romance', 'Comedy', 'Melodrama']",,

1180,Perfect Sense,"K-pop (abbreviation of Korean pop; Hangul: 케이팝) is a genre of popular music originating in South Korea. While the modern form of K-pop can be traced back to the early 90s, the term itself has been popularized since the 2000s, replacing the term Gayo (가요), which also refers to domestic pop music in South Korea. Although it generally indicates ""popular music"" within South Korea, the term is often used in a narrower sense to describe a modern form of South Korean pop that is influenced by styles and genres from around the world, such as experimental, rock, jazz, gospel, hip hop, R&B, reggae, electronic dance, folk, country, and classical on top of its traditional Korean music roots. The more modern form of the genre emerged with the formation of one of the earliest K-pop groups, Seo Taiji and Boys, in 1992. Their experimentation with different styles and genres of music and integration of foreign musical elements helped reshape and modernize South Korea's contemporary music scene.Modern K-pop ""idol"" culture began with the boy band H.O.T. in 1996, as K-pop grew into a subculture that amassed enormous fandoms of teenagers and young adults. After a slump in early K-pop, from 2003 TVXQ and BoA started a new generation of K-pop idols that broke the music genre into the neighboring Japanese market and continue to popularize K-pop internationally today. With the advent of online social networking services and Korean TV shows, the current spread of K-pop and Korean entertainment, known as the Korean Wave, is seen not only in East Asia and Southeast Asia, but also in India, Latin America, North Africa, Southern Africa, the Middle East and throughout the Western world, gaining a widespread global audience.","['All articles lacking reliable references', 'All articles with failed verification', 'All articles with style issues', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Articles containing Japanese-language text', 'Articles containing Korean-language text', 'Articles containing video clips', 'Articles lacking reliable references from December 2018', 'Articles lacking reliable references from March 2013', 'Articles lacking reliable references from March 2019', 'Articles with Korean-language external links', 'Articles with failed verification from February 2019', 'Articles with hAudio microformats', 'Articles with short description', 'Articles with unsourced statements from August 2018', 'Articles with unsourced statements from January 2019', 'Articles with unsourced statements from March 2019', 'CS1 German-language sources (de)', 'CS1 Hungarian-language sources (hu)', 'CS1 Japanese-language sources (ja)', 'CS1 Korean-language sources (ko)', 'CS1 Spanish-language sources (es)', 'CS1 Turkish-language sources (tr)', 'CS1 Vietnamese-language sources (vi)', 'CS1 maint: BOT: original-url status unknown', 'CS1 maint: Multiple names: authors list', 'CS1 uses Korean-language script (ko)', 'Commons category link is on Wikidata', 'Interlanguage link template link number', 'K-pop', 'Pages using multiple image with auto scaled images', 'Pages with citations having bare URLs', 'Pages with citations lacking titles', 'South Korean popular culture', 'Use mdy dates from March 2019', 'Webarchive template archiveis links', 'Webarchive template wayback links', 'Wikipedia articles with style issues from December 2018', 'Wikipedia pending changes protected pages']",['Melodrama'],KBS2,"The drama portrays the life of a young blind woman, Eun Seo (<a href=""http://star.koreandrama.org/choi-soo-young/"" target=""_blank"">Choi Soo Young</a>) who is an English teacher and lose his eyesight due to degenerative disease of the retina."

The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time, ruling most of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia, under Gwanggaeto the Great. South Korea lies in the north temperate zone and has a predominantly mountainous terrain. It comprises an estimated 51.4 million residents distributed over 100,363 km2 (38,750 sq mi). Its capital and largest city is Seoul, with a population of around 10 million.
Archaeology indicates that the Korean Peninsula was inhabited by early humans starting from the Lower Paleolithic period (2.6 Ma–300 Ka). The history of Korea begins with the foundation of Gojoseon in 2333 BCE by the mythic king Dangun, but no archaeological evidence and writing was found from this period. The Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in 11th century BCE, and its existence and role has been controversial in the modern era. The written historical record on Gojoseon (Old Joseon) was first mentioned in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under Unified Silla in CE 668, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910). It was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. At the end of World War II, Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S. zones of occupations. A separate election was held in the U.S. zone in 1948 which led to the creation of the Republic of Korea (ROK), while the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was established in the Soviet zone. The United Nations at the time passed a resolution declaring the ROK to be the only lawful government in Korea.The Korean War began in June 1950 when forces from North Korea invaded South Korea. The war lasted three years and involved the U.S., China, the Soviet Union and several other nations. The border between the two nations remains the most heavily fortified in the world.

1209,You Are Very Good,"Education in South Korea is provided by both public schools and private schools. Both types of schools receive funding from the government, although the amount that the private schools receive is less than the amount of the state schools. In recent years, Incheon Global Campus  (with start-up support) has kick-started, and Yonsei University opened an international college  to embrace the full English teaching environment scheme.
South Korea is one of the top-performing OECD countries in reading literacy, mathematics and sciences with the average student scoring 542. The country has one of the worlds highest-educated labour forces among OECD countries. The country is well known for its obsession with education, which has come to be called ""education fever"". The resource-poor nation is consistently ranked amongst the top for global education. In the 2014 national rankings of students’ math and science scores by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), South Korea ranked second place worldwide, after Singapore.Higher education is an overwhelmingly serious issue in South Korea society, where it is viewed as one of the fundamental cornerstones of South Korean life. Education is regarded with a high priority for South Korean families, as success in education is necessary for improving one's socioeconomic position in South Korean society. Academic success is often a source of pride for families and within South Korean society at large. South Koreans view education as the main propeller of social mobility for themselves and their family as a gateway to the South Korean middle class. Graduating from a top university is the ultimate marker of prestige, high socioeconomic status, promising marriage prospects, and a respectable career path. An average South Korean child's life revolves around education as pressure to succeed academically is deeply ingrained in South Korean children from an early age. Those who lack a formal university education often face social prejudice.In 2015, the country spent 4.7% of its GDP on all levels of education – roughly equal to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) average. A strong investment in education, a militant drive for success, as well as the passion for excellence has helped the resource poor country rapidly grow its economy over the past 60 years from a war-torn wasteland. South Korea’s zeal for education and its students’ desires to get into a prestigious university is one of the highest in the world, as the entrance into a top tier higher educational institution leads to a prestigious, secure and well-paid white collar job with the government, banks, a major South Korean conglomerate such as Samsung, Hyundai or LG Electronics. With incredible pressure on high school students to secure places at the nation’s best universities, its institutional reputation and alumni networks are strong predictors of future career prospects. The top three universities in South Korea, often referred to as ""SKY"", are Seoul National University, Korea University and Yonsei University. Intense competition and pressure to earn the highest grades is deeply ingrained in the psyche of South Korean students at a young age. Yet with only so many places at universities and even fewer places at top-tier companies, many young people remain disappointed and are often unwilling to lower their sights with the result of many feeling as underachievers. 
There is a major cultural taboo in South Korean society attached to those who have not achieved formal university education, where those who don't hold university degrees face social prejudice and are often looked down by others as second-class citizens, resulting fewer opportunities for employment, improvement of one's socioeconomic position and prospects for marriage.International reception on the South Korean education system has been divided. It has been praised for various reasons, including its comparatively high test results and its major role in ushering South Korea's economic development creating one of the world’s most educated workforces.
South Korea's highly enviable academic performance has gotten British education ministers actively remodeling their own curriculum's and exams to try to emulate Korea's militant drive and passion for excellence and high educational achievement. U.S. President Barack Obama has also praised the country's rigorous school system, where over 80 percent of South Korean high school graduates go on to university. The nation's high university entrance rate has created a highly skilled workforce making South Korea among the most highly educated countries in the world with the one of the highest percentage of its citizens holding a tertiary education degree. Bachelor's degrees are held by 68 percent of South Koreans aged 25–34, the most in the OECD.The system's rigid and hierarchical structure has been criticized for stifling creativity and innovation; described as intensely and ""brutally"" competitive, The system is often blamed for the high suicide rate in South Korea, particularly the growing rates among those aged 10–19. Various media outlets attribute the nations high suicide rate on the nationwide anxiety around the country's college entrance exams, which determine the trajectory of students' entire lives and careers.  Former South Korean hagwon teacher Se-Woong Koo wrote that the South Korean education system amounts to child abuse and that it should be ""reformed and restructured without delay."" The system has also been criticized for producing an excess supply of university graduates creating an overeducated and underemployed labor force; in the first quarter of 2013 alone, nearly 3.3 million South Korean university graduates were jobless, leading many graduates overqualified for jobs requiring less education. Further criticism has been stemmed for causing labor shortages in various skilled blue collar labor and vocational occupations, where many go unfilled as the negative social stigma associated with vocational careers and not having a university degree continues to remain deep-rooted in South Korean society.","['All articles needing additional references', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Articles containing Korean-language text', 'Articles needing additional references from July 2010', 'Articles with unsourced statements from April 2008', 'Articles with unsourced statements from August 2014', 'Articles with unsourced statements from February 2008', 'Articles with unsourced statements from January 2009', 'Articles with unsourced statements from June 2008', 'CS1 Korean-language sources (ko)', 'CS1 Spanish-language sources (es)', 'CS1 uses Korean-language script (ko)', 'Education in South Korea', 'Pages using deprecated image syntax', 'Pages with URL errors', 'Wikipedia articles needing clarification from September 2012']",['Romance'],KBS2,"><p><img alt=""ilikeyou.jpg"" src=""https://www.koreandrama.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/ilikeyou.jpg""/></p><p>Title: 난 네게 반했어 / You Are Very Good<br/> Chinese title : 我被你迷住了<br/> Also known as: I Am Smittened By You / I Like You / You Stole My Heart<br/> Genre: Romance<br/> Episodes: 156<br/> Broadcast network: KBS2<br/> Broadcast period: 2008-Apr-21 to 2008-Oct-18<br/> Air time: Mondays to Saturdays 9:00am</p><p><span id=""more-722""></span></p><p><strong>Synopsis </strong></p><p>Kang Gi Jo (Lee Jung Gil) is a middle-class herbal doctor who leases the upstairs of their home to Bae Duk Bae’s family.

1210,The Musical,"South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (ROK), is a country in East Asia, constituting the southern part of the Korean Peninsula and lying to the east of the Asian mainland. The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time, ruling most of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia, under Gwanggaeto the Great. South Korea lies in the north temperate zone and has a predominantly mountainous terrain. It comprises an estimated 51.4 million residents distributed over 100,363 km2 (38,750 sq mi). Its capital and largest city is Seoul, with a population of around 10 million.
Archaeology indicates that the Korean Peninsula was inhabited by early humans starting from the Lower Paleolithic period (2.6 Ma–300 Ka). The history of Korea begins with the foundation of Gojoseon in 2333 BCE by the mythic king Dangun, but no archaeological evidence and writing was found from this period. The Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in 11th century BCE, and its existence and role has been controversial in the modern era. The written historical record on Gojoseon (Old Joseon) was first mentioned in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under Unified Silla in CE 668, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910). It was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. At the end of World War II, Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S. zones of occupations. A separate election was held in the U.S. zone in 1948 which led to the creation of the Republic of Korea (ROK), while the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was established in the Soviet zone. The United Nations at the time passed a resolution declaring the ROK to be the only lawful government in Korea.The Korean War began in June 1950 when forces from North Korea invaded South Korea. The war lasted three years and involved the U.S., China, the Soviet Union and several other nations. The border between the two nations remains the most heavily fortified in the world. Under long-time military leader Park Chung-hee, the South Korean economy grew significantly and the country was transformed into a G-20 major economy. Military rule ended in 1987, and the country is now a presidential republic consisting of 17 administrative divisions.
South Korea is a highly developed country and a high-income economy, with a ""very high"" Human Development Index, ranking 22nd in the world. The country is considered a regional power and is the world's 11th largest economy by nominal GDP and the 12th largest by PPP as of 2010. South Korea is a global leader in the industrial and technological sectors, being the world's 5th largest exporter and 8th largest importer.

The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time, ruling most of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia, under Gwanggaeto the Great. South Korea lies in the north temperate zone and has a predominantly mountainous terrain. It comprises an estimated 51.4 million residents distributed over 100,363 km2 (38,750 sq mi). Its capital and largest city is Seoul, with a population of around 10 million.
Archaeology indicates that the Korean Peninsula was inhabited by early humans starting from the Lower Paleolithic period (2.6 Ma–300 Ka). The history of Korea begins with the foundation of Gojoseon in 2333 BCE by the mythic king Dangun, but no archaeological evidence and writing was found from this period. The Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in 11th century BCE, and its existence and role has been controversial in the modern era. The written historical record on Gojoseon (Old Joseon) was first mentioned in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under Unified Silla in CE 668, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910). It was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. At the end of World War II, Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S. zones of occupations. A separate election was held in the U.S. zone in 1948 which led to the creation of the Republic of Korea (ROK), while the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was established in the Soviet zone. The United Nations at the time passed a resolution declaring the ROK to be the only lawful government in Korea.The Korean War began in June 1950 when forces from North Korea invaded South Korea. The war lasted three years and involved the U.S., China, the Soviet Union and several other nations. The border between the two nations remains the most heavily fortified in the world. Under long-time military leader Park Chung-hee, the South Korean economy grew significantly and the country was transformed into a G-20 major economy. Military rule ended in 1987, and the country is now a presidential republic consisting of 17 administrative divisions.
South Korea is a highly developed country and a high-income economy, with a ""very high"" Human Development Index, ranking 22nd in the world. The country is considered a regional power and is the world's 11th largest economy by nominal GDP and the 12th largest by PPP as of 2010. South Korea is a global leader in the industrial and technological sectors, being the world's 5th largest exporter and 8th largest importer. Its export-driven economy primarily focuses production on electronics, automobiles, ships, machinery, petrochemicals and robotics.

The United Nations at the time passed a resolution declaring the ROK to be the only lawful government in Korea.The Korean War began in June 1950 when forces from North Korea invaded South Korea. The war lasted three years and involved the U.S., China, the Soviet Union and several other nations. The border between the two nations remains the most heavily fortified in the world. Under long-time military leader Park Chung-hee, the South Korean economy grew significantly and the country was transformed into a G-20 major economy. Military rule ended in 1987, and the country is now a presidential republic consisting of 17 administrative divisions.
South Korea is a highly developed country and a high-income economy, with a ""very high"" Human Development Index, ranking 22nd in the world. The country is considered a regional power and is the world's 11th largest economy by nominal GDP and the 12th largest by PPP as of 2010. South Korea is a global leader in the industrial and technological sectors, being the world's 5th largest exporter and 8th largest importer.

When Jeju was struck by a deadly famine in 1795 (the 19th year of  King Jeongjo, Kim sold all her assets and donated approximately 90% of her money (approximated to be ₩70 billion in today's currency) to save millions of lives.

The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time, ruling most of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia, under Gwanggaeto the Great. South Korea lies in the north temperate zone and has a predominantly mountainous terrain. It comprises an estimated 51.4 million residents distributed over 100,363 km2 (38,750 sq mi). Its capital and largest city is Seoul, with a population of around 10 million.
Archaeology indicates that the Korean Peninsula was inhabited by early humans starting from the Lower Paleolithic period (2.6 Ma–300 Ka). The history of Korea begins with the foundation of Gojoseon in 2333 BCE by the mythic king Dangun, but no archaeological evidence and writing was found from this period. The Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in 11th century BCE, and its existence and role has been controversial in the modern era. The written historical record on Gojoseon (Old Joseon) was first mentioned in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under Unified Silla in CE 668, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910). It was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. At the end of World War II, Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S. zones of occupations. A separate election was held in the U.S. zone in 1948 which led to the creation of the Republic of Korea (ROK), while the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was established in the Soviet zone. The United Nations at the time passed a resolution declaring the ROK to be the only lawful government in Korea.The Korean War began in June 1950 when forces from North Korea invaded South Korea. The war lasted three years and involved the U.S., China, the Soviet Union and several other nations. The border between the two nations remains the most heavily fortified in the world. Under long-time military leader Park Chung-hee, the South Korean economy grew significantly and the country was transformed into a G-20 major economy. Military rule ended in 1987, and the country is now a presidential republic consisting of 17 administrative divisions.
South Korea is a highly developed country and a high-income economy, with a ""very high"" Human Development Index, ranking 22nd in the world. The country is considered a regional power and is the world's 11th largest economy by nominal GDP and the 12th largest by PPP as of 2010.

As of 2017, the album has sold 900,000 copies worldwide according to the IFPI.The album spawned three top twenty singles in the United States. The lead single, ""Dangerous Woman"", was released on March 11, 2016, debuted at number ten, and later peaked at number eight on the US Billboard Hot 100. The second single, ""Into You"", peaked at number 13, while the third single ""Side to Side"" became the first top five single from the album, peaking at number four on that chart, where it became the albums highest charting single. All three of the aforementioned singles have been certified multiple platinum in the United States. Two promotional singles were released for the album: ""Be Alright"" and ""Let Me Love You"" (featuring Lil Wayne).
The album received positive reviews from critics, appearing on the year-end lists of several publications. It received a Grammy nomination for Best Pop Vocal Album. To promote the album, Grande performed at the MTV Movie Awards, Billboard Music Awards, MTV Video Music Awards, and American Music Awards. She also appeared on an episode of Saturday Night Live as both the host and musical guest. Furthermore, Grande embarked on a concert tour, entitled the Dangerous Woman Tour, starting in February 3, 2017 and ending in September 21, 2017. This tour was interrupted on May 22, 2017 due to a suicide bombing attack at the end of Grande's concert on Manchester Arena. Due to this tragedy, Grande created a benefit concert on June 4, 2017, named One Love Manchester that took place at the Old Trafford Cricket Ground in Manchester.","['2016 albums', 'Albums produced by Ilya Salmanzadeh', 'Albums produced by Max Martin', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Ariana Grande albums', 'Articles with hAudio microformats', 'Articles with short description', 'Articles with unsourced statements from March 2019', 'CS1 Chinese-language sources (zh)', 'CS1 Danish-language sources (da)', 'CS1 French-language sources (fr)', 'CS1 German-language sources (de)', 'CS1 Italian-language sources (it)', 'CS1 Japanese-language sources (ja)', 'CS1 Korean-language sources (ko)', 'CS1 Polish-language sources (pl)', 'CS1 Portuguese-language sources (pt)', 'CS1 Spanish-language sources (es)', 'CS1 Swedish-language sources (sv)', 'CS1 uses Japanese-language script (ja)', 'Certification Table Entry usages for Austria', 'Certification Table Entry usages for Brazil', 'Certification Table Entry usages for Canada', 'Certification Table Entry usages for Denmark', 'Certification Table Entry usages for France', 'Certification Table Entry usages for Italy', 'Certification Table Entry usages for Japan', 'Certification Table Entry usages for Mexico', 'Certification Table Entry usages for Poland', 'Certification Table Entry usages for Sweden', 'Certification Table Entry usages for United Kingdom', 'Certification Table Entry usages for United States', 'Pages containing links to subscription-only content', 'Pages using certification Table Entry with unknown parameters', 'Republic Records albums', 'Use mdy dates from December 2018']","['Romance', 'Family']",MBC,A drama about a daughter of an entrepeneur fighting against a plot to take over her father’s business.

1272,What’s With Money?,"South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (ROK), is a country in East Asia, constituting the southern part of the Korean Peninsula and lying to the east of the Asian mainland. The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time, ruling most of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia, under Gwanggaeto the Great. South Korea lies in the north temperate zone and has a predominantly mountainous terrain. It comprises an estimated 51.4 million residents distributed over 100,363 km2 (38,750 sq mi). Its capital and largest city is Seoul, with a population of around 10 million.
Archaeology indicates that the Korean Peninsula was inhabited by early humans starting from the Lower Paleolithic period (2.6 Ma–300 Ka). The history of Korea begins with the foundation of Gojoseon in 2333 BCE by the mythic king Dangun, but no archaeological evidence and writing was found from this period. The Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in 11th century BCE, and its existence and role has been controversial in the modern era. The written historical record on Gojoseon (Old Joseon) was first mentioned in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under Unified Silla in CE 668, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910). It was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. At the end of World War II, Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S. zones of occupations. A separate election was held in the U.S. zone in 1948 which led to the creation of the Republic of Korea (ROK), while the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was established in the Soviet zone. The United Nations at the time passed a resolution declaring the ROK to be the only lawful government in Korea.The Korean War began in June 1950 when forces from North Korea invaded South Korea. The war lasted three years and involved the U.S., China, the Soviet Union and several other nations. The border between the two nations remains the most heavily fortified in the world. Under long-time military leader Park Chung-hee, the South Korean economy grew significantly and the country was transformed into a G-20 major economy. Military rule ended in 1987, and the country is now a presidential republic consisting of 17 administrative divisions.
South Korea is a highly developed country and a high-income economy, with a ""very high"" Human Development Index, ranking 22nd in the world. The country is considered a regional power and is the world's 11th largest economy by nominal GDP and the 12th largest by PPP as of 2010. South Korea is a global leader in the industrial and technological sectors, being the world's 5th largest exporter and 8th largest importer.

1284,Family Photo,"South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (ROK), is a country in East Asia, constituting the southern part of the Korean Peninsula and lying to the east of the Asian mainland. The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time, ruling most of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia, under Gwanggaeto the Great. South Korea lies in the north temperate zone and has a predominantly mountainous terrain. It comprises an estimated 51.4 million residents distributed over 100,363 km2 (38,750 sq mi). Its capital and largest city is Seoul, with a population of around 10 million.
Archaeology indicates that the Korean Peninsula was inhabited by early humans starting from the Lower Paleolithic period (2.6 Ma–300 Ka). The history of Korea begins with the foundation of Gojoseon in 2333 BCE by the mythic king Dangun, but no archaeological evidence and writing was found from this period. The Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in 11th century BCE, and its existence and role has been controversial in the modern era. The written historical record on Gojoseon (Old Joseon) was first mentioned in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under Unified Silla in CE 668, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910). It was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. At the end of World War II, Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S. zones of occupations. A separate election was held in the U.S. zone in 1948 which led to the creation of the Republic of Korea (ROK), while the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was established in the Soviet zone. The United Nations at the time passed a resolution declaring the ROK to be the only lawful government in Korea.The Korean War began in June 1950 when forces from North Korea invaded South Korea. The war lasted three years and involved the U.S., China, the Soviet Union and several other nations. The border between the two nations remains the most heavily fortified in the world. Under long-time military leader Park Chung-hee, the South Korean economy grew significantly and the country was transformed into a G-20 major economy. Military rule ended in 1987, and the country is now a presidential republic consisting of 17 administrative divisions.
South Korea is a highly developed country and a high-income economy, with a ""very high"" Human Development Index, ranking 22nd in the world. The country is considered a regional power and is the world's 11th largest economy by nominal GDP and the 12th largest by PPP as of 2010. South Korea is a global leader in the industrial and technological sectors, being the world's 5th largest exporter and 8th largest importer. Its export-driven economy primarily focuses production on electronics, automobiles, ships, machinery, petrochemicals and robotics.

1298,Women of The Sun,"Women in South Korea have experienced significant improvements for social changes in recent years, compared to previous times,  when Confucianism was deeply imbued in the culture.  In today's society, the economy of South Korea has tremendously improved due to urbanisation, industrialisation, military authoritarianism, democratic reform, and social liberalisation since the late 1960s. Thus, gender roles and gender identities eventually have been modified as a result to changing modernity.  More than the half of Korean women are employed and furthermore, more than 25% of married women are employed as full-time workers. In politics, although there are not as many female politicians as male politicians, the female politicians have recently begun to participate more actively than in the past. For instance, in National Assembly, women occupy 20 of the 299 seats.
The status of women vary depending on their social class and financial independence. In metropolitan areas, women have more access to education, which means they are less confined to the home as housewives. Most of the employed women in urban areas work in tertiary industries such as the service sector. Therefore, as working-class women, they have more power in making decisions within their households and are more financially independent. On the other hand, in rural areas, most of women work in primary industry such as the agriculture sector. In fact, they do not have the variety of educational and employment opportunities.
The status of women has elevated to the point where it could be seen as equal to men's social standing  in terms of education, health, and legal rights. However, there are still plenty of political and economical prejudices against women.  Moreover, Korean women are still consistently facing gender stereotypes regarding rigid gender roles. These stereotypes include women staying at home as housewives, being subordinate to men, having less power and voice in political and economic participation and movements, and many more. Women in South Korea are not restricted to dressing in a certain way, they follow a Western style of dress.","['All Wikipedia articles in need of updating', 'All articles needing additional references', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Articles needing additional references from April 2014', 'Articles with multiple maintenance issues', 'Articles with unsourced statements from June 2016', 'Articles with unsourced statements from March 2011', 'CS1: long volume value', 'Commons category link is on Wikidata', 'Commons category link is on Wikidata using P373', 'Wikipedia articles in need of updating from November 2010', 'Wikipedia articles incorporating text from the Library of Congress Country Studies', 'Women by country', 'Women in South Korea']","['Romance', 'melodrama']",KBS2,"Shin Do Young is an announcer who instigates the jealously of all women around her because of her superior looks, great abilities, and great background.

1299,The Greatest Thing in the World,"Big Bang (Hangul: 빅뱅; stylized as BIGBANG) is a South Korean boy band formed by YG Entertainment. The group consists of 4 members: G-Dragon, T.O.P, Taeyang, and Daesung. Member Seungri retired from the industry on March 11, 2019. They are often cited as one of the most influential acts to shape the K-pop industry by helping spread the Korean Wave internationally and dubbed as  the ""Kings of K-pop"" by the media. Their experimental and diverse use of music genres, personal involvement in producing their own records, and stage performances have been admired by music critics and served as influence to numerous K-pop and international artists.Despite their debut album, Bigbang Vol.1 (2006), receiving lukewarm reception, success followed with a string of notable hits credited to the quintet, including ""Lies"" (Korean: 거짓말), which topped major Korean music charts for a record-breaking six consecutive weeks and won Song of the Year at the 2007 Mnet Km Music Festival and the 2008 Seoul Music Awards; ""Last Farewell"" (Korean: 마지막 인사); ""Day by Day"" (Korean: 하루하루); and ""Sunset Glow"" (Korean: 붉은노을). After receiving the Artist of the Year award from the 2008 Mnet Korean Music Festival and the 2008 Seoul Music Awards, the group expanded their endeavors to Japan, releasing four studio albums, Big Bang (2009), Big Bang 2 (2011), Alive (2012), and Made Series (2016), which are all certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of Japan.
After a two-year hiatus in South Korea, the quintet produced increasingly innovative and critically acclaimed recordings. Their fourth EP, Tonight (2011), lead to their emergence as the inaugural Best Worldwide Act winner at the 2011 MTV Europe Music Awards. Their fifth EP, Alive (2012), became the first Korean album to chart on the Billboard 200. Their widely acclaimed third album, Made (2016), was preceded by several chart-topping singles, winning the group their third Artist of the Year award at the 2015 Mnet Asian Music Awards and their first at the 2015 Melon Music Awards. The supporting world tour gathered 1.5 million people in attendance, making it the most attended concert tour headlined by a Korean act in history.Big Bang has a record of 18 number-one songs that have collectively remained atop South Korean's biggest online music service Melon for 51 weeks, more than any other act. The quintet have sold over 140 million records and counting, making them one of the biggest-selling boy-bands in the world beating out American favorites like the Backstreet Boys and the Jackson Five. Forbes Korea ranked them as one of the most powerful celebrities in South Korea in 2010, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2016. They were also the first Korean artists to enter Forbes' Celebrity 100 and the 30 under 30 list of most influential musicians in the world, in 2016 and 2017, respectively.","['All articles with peacock terms', 'Articles containing Japanese-language text', 'Articles containing Korean-language text', 'Articles with Korean-language external links', 'Articles with hAudio microformats', 'Articles with hCards', 'Articles with peacock terms from April 2019', 'Articles with short description', 'Avex Group artists', 'Big Bang (South Korean band)', 'CS1 Chinese-language sources (zh)', 'CS1 Greek-language sources (el)', 'CS1 Japanese-language sources (ja)', 'CS1 Korean-language sources (ko)', 'CS1 Spanish-language sources (es)', 'CS1 Vietnamese-language sources (vi)', 'CS1 maint: BOT: original-url status unknown', 'CS1 uses Korean-language script (ko)', 'Commons category link is on Wikidata', 'Good articles', 'Grand Prize Golden Disc Award recipients', 'K-pop music groups', 'Korean Music Award winners', 'Melon Music Award winners', 'Mnet Asian Music Award winners', 'Musical groups established in 2006', 'Musical groups from Seoul', 'Musical quintets', 'Pages containing links to subscription-only content', 'South Korean boy bands', 'South Korean contemporary R&B musical groups', 'South Korean dance music groups', 'South Korean electronic musicians', 'South Korean hip hop groups', 'South Korean pop music groups', 'Universal Music Japan artists', 'Webarchive template wayback links', 'Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with MusicBrainz identifiers', 'Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages', 'YG Entertainment artists']","['Family', 'Romance', 'Comedy']",MBC,"A short Chuseok special drama about the social matters of teenage parenting and adoption.</p><p>Woo Sun (<a href=""http://star.koreandrama.org/?p=14818"" target=""_blank"">Choi Yoon Young</a>) is a strong minded woman with an even stronger ego and John Harrison (<a href=""http://star.koreandrama.org/?p=6892"" target=""_blank"">Lee Sang Yeob</a>) who was adopted to Australia when he was young."

1312,My Life’s Golden Age,"South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (ROK), is a country in East Asia, constituting the southern part of the Korean Peninsula and lying to the east of the Asian mainland. The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time, ruling most of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia, under Gwanggaeto the Great. South Korea lies in the north temperate zone and has a predominantly mountainous terrain. It comprises an estimated 51.4 million residents distributed over 100,363 km2 (38,750 sq mi). Its capital and largest city is Seoul, with a population of around 10 million.
Archaeology indicates that the Korean Peninsula was inhabited by early humans starting from the Lower Paleolithic period (2.6 Ma–300 Ka). The history of Korea begins with the foundation of Gojoseon in 2333 BCE by the mythic king Dangun, but no archaeological evidence and writing was found from this period. The Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in 11th century BCE, and its existence and role has been controversial in the modern era. The written historical record on Gojoseon (Old Joseon) was first mentioned in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under Unified Silla in CE 668, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910). It was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. At the end of World War II, Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S. zones of occupations. A separate election was held in the U.S. zone in 1948 which led to the creation of the Republic of Korea (ROK), while the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was established in the Soviet zone. The United Nations at the time passed a resolution declaring the ROK to be the only lawful government in Korea.The Korean War began in June 1950 when forces from North Korea invaded South Korea. The war lasted three years and involved the U.S., China, the Soviet Union and several other nations. The border between the two nations remains the most heavily fortified in the world. Under long-time military leader Park Chung-hee, the South Korean economy grew significantly and the country was transformed into a G-20 major economy. Military rule ended in 1987, and the country is now a presidential republic consisting of 17 administrative divisions.
South Korea is a highly developed country and a high-income economy, with a ""very high"" Human Development Index, ranking 22nd in the world. The country is considered a regional power and is the world's 11th largest economy by nominal GDP and the 12th largest by PPP as of 2010. South Korea is a global leader in the industrial and technological sectors, being the world's 5th largest exporter and 8th largest importer. Its export-driven economy primarily focuses production on electronics, automobiles, ships, machinery, petrochemicals and robotics.

1324,Hometown Over the Hill (Season 1),"South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (ROK), is a country in East Asia, constituting the southern part of the Korean Peninsula and lying to the east of the Asian mainland. The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time, ruling most of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia, under Gwanggaeto the Great. South Korea lies in the north temperate zone and has a predominantly mountainous terrain. It comprises an estimated 51.4 million residents distributed over 100,363 km2 (38,750 sq mi). Its capital and largest city is Seoul, with a population of around 10 million.
Archaeology indicates that the Korean Peninsula was inhabited by early humans starting from the Lower Paleolithic period (2.6 Ma–300 Ka). The history of Korea begins with the foundation of Gojoseon in 2333 BCE by the mythic king Dangun, but no archaeological evidence and writing was found from this period. The Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in 11th century BCE, and its existence and role has been controversial in the modern era.

It is because they adopted the topics which can always trigger interest anytime anywhere. ‘A Second Proposal’ shows happenings often found around us in daily lives, but looks at the family issues from a different perspective. It approaches the traditional family problems such as love, marriage and affairs from a light but comic and touching way. A housewife who was regarded as an ugly duckling will be transformed into a graceful swan. How she makes the transformation will be the main theme, and her success story will deliver the sense of satisfaction to lots of housewife viewers in Korea, who find them powerless but actually are strong.

The situations and problems are not that peculiar, so that the audience can believe that they can occur to ‘them’ as well.

1335,Late Night Hospital,"Saturday Night Live (SNL) is an American late-night live television variety show created by Lorne Michaels and developed by Dick Ebersol. The show premiered on NBC on October 11, 1975, under the original title NBC's Saturday Night. The show's comedy sketches, which often parody contemporary culture and politics, are performed by a large and varying cast of repertory and newer cast members. Each episode is hosted by a celebrity guest, who usually delivers the opening monologue and performs in sketches with the cast as with featured performances by a musical guest. An episode normally begins with a cold open sketch that ends with someone breaking character and proclaiming, ""Live from New York, it's Saturday Night!"", properly beginning the show.
In 1980, Michaels left the series to explore other opportunities. He was replaced by Jean Doumanian, who was replaced by Ebersol after a season of bad reviews. Ebersol ran the show until 1985. Since Michaels' return he has held the job of show-runner. Many of SNL's cast found national stardom while appearing on the show, and achieved success in film and television, both in front of and behind the camera. Others associated with the show, such as writers, have gone on to successful careers creating, writing, and starring in television and film.

1340,Special of My Life,"South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (ROK), is a country in East Asia, constituting the southern part of the Korean Peninsula and lying to the east of the Asian mainland. The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time, ruling most of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia, under Gwanggaeto the Great. South Korea lies in the north temperate zone and has a predominantly mountainous terrain. It comprises an estimated 51.4 million residents distributed over 100,363 km2 (38,750 sq mi). Its capital and largest city is Seoul, with a population of around 10 million.
Archaeology indicates that the Korean Peninsula was inhabited by early humans starting from the Lower Paleolithic period (2.6 Ma–300 Ka). The history of Korea begins with the foundation of Gojoseon in 2333 BCE by the mythic king Dangun, but no archaeological evidence and writing was found from this period. The Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in 11th century BCE, and its existence and role has been controversial in the modern era. The written historical record on Gojoseon (Old Joseon) was first mentioned in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under Unified Silla in CE 668, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910). It was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. At the end of World War II, Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S. zones of occupations. A separate election was held in the U.S. zone in 1948 which led to the creation of the Republic of Korea (ROK), while the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was established in the Soviet zone. The United Nations at the time passed a resolution declaring the ROK to be the only lawful government in Korea.The Korean War began in June 1950 when forces from North Korea invaded South Korea. The war lasted three years and involved the U.S., China, the Soviet Union and several other nations. The border between the two nations remains the most heavily fortified in the world. Under long-time military leader Park Chung-hee, the South Korean economy grew significantly and the country was transformed into a G-20 major economy. Military rule ended in 1987, and the country is now a presidential republic consisting of 17 administrative divisions.
South Korea is a highly developed country and a high-income economy, with a ""very high"" Human Development Index, ranking 22nd in the world.

Therefore, this drama plans to show the viewers something more relatable – love that blooms in our everyday lives. This drama shows how a familiar relationship turns into a fluttering relationship, how a friendship suddenly turns into love, and how a once dull life suddenly becomes blinding due to love. This drama is about a man and a woman who have nothing more to share thanks to their completely different personalities. However, they have no idea whom they are in love with.

The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time, ruling most of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia, under Gwanggaeto the Great. South Korea lies in the north temperate zone and has a predominantly mountainous terrain. It comprises an estimated 51.4 million residents distributed over 100,363 km2 (38,750 sq mi). Its capital and largest city is Seoul, with a population of around 10 million.
Archaeology indicates that the Korean Peninsula was inhabited by early humans starting from the Lower Paleolithic period (2.6 Ma–300 Ka). The history of Korea begins with the foundation of Gojoseon in 2333 BCE by the mythic king Dangun, but no archaeological evidence and writing was found from this period. The Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in 11th century BCE, and its existence and role has been controversial in the modern era. The written historical record on Gojoseon (Old Joseon) was first mentioned in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under Unified Silla in CE 668, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910). It was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. At the end of World War II, Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S. zones of occupations. A separate election was held in the U.S. zone in 1948 which led to the creation of the Republic of Korea (ROK), while the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was established in the Soviet zone. The United Nations at the time passed a resolution declaring the ROK to be the only lawful government in Korea.The Korean War began in June 1950 when forces from North Korea invaded South Korea. The war lasted three years and involved the U.S., China, the Soviet Union and several other nations. The border between the two nations remains the most heavily fortified in the world.

Member Seungri retired from the industry on March 11, 2019. They are often cited as one of the most influential acts to shape the K-pop industry by helping spread the Korean Wave internationally and dubbed as  the ""Kings of K-pop"" by the media. Their experimental and diverse use of music genres, personal involvement in producing their own records, and stage performances have been admired by music critics and served as influence to numerous K-pop and international artists.Despite their debut album, Bigbang Vol.1 (2006), receiving lukewarm reception, success followed with a string of notable hits credited to the quintet, including ""Lies"" (Korean: 거짓말), which topped major Korean music charts for a record-breaking six consecutive weeks and won Song of the Year at the 2007 Mnet Km Music Festival and the 2008 Seoul Music Awards; ""Last Farewell"" (Korean: 마지막 인사); ""Day by Day"" (Korean: 하루하루); and ""Sunset Glow"" (Korean: 붉은노을). After receiving the Artist of the Year award from the 2008 Mnet Korean Music Festival and the 2008 Seoul Music Awards, the group expanded their endeavors to Japan, releasing four studio albums, Big Bang (2009), Big Bang 2 (2011), Alive (2012), and Made Series (2016), which are all certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of Japan.
After a two-year hiatus in South Korea, the quintet produced increasingly innovative and critically acclaimed recordings. Their fourth EP, Tonight (2011), lead to their emergence as the inaugural Best Worldwide Act winner at the 2011 MTV Europe Music Awards. Their fifth EP, Alive (2012), became the first Korean album to chart on the Billboard 200. Their widely acclaimed third album, Made (2016), was preceded by several chart-topping singles, winning the group their third Artist of the Year award at the 2015 Mnet Asian Music Awards and their first at the 2015 Melon Music Awards. The supporting world tour gathered 1.5 million people in attendance, making it the most attended concert tour headlined by a Korean act in history.Big Bang has a record of 18 number-one songs that have collectively remained atop South Korean's biggest online music service Melon for 51 weeks, more than any other act. The quintet have sold over 140 million records and counting, making them one of the biggest-selling boy-bands in the world beating out American favorites like the Backstreet Boys and the Jackson Five. Forbes Korea ranked them as one of the most powerful celebrities in South Korea in 2010, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2016. They were also the first Korean artists to enter Forbes' Celebrity 100 and the 30 under 30 list of most influential musicians in the world, in 2016 and 2017, respectively.","['All articles with peacock terms', 'Articles containing Japanese-language text', 'Articles containing Korean-language text', 'Articles with Korean-language external links', 'Articles with hAudio microformats', 'Articles with hCards', 'Articles with peacock terms from April 2019', 'Articles with short description', 'Avex Group artists', 'Big Bang (South Korean band)', 'CS1 Chinese-language sources (zh)', 'CS1 Greek-language sources (el)', 'CS1 Japanese-language sources (ja)', 'CS1 Korean-language sources (ko)', 'CS1 Spanish-language sources (es)', 'CS1 Vietnamese-language sources (vi)', 'CS1 maint: BOT: original-url status unknown', 'CS1 uses Korean-language script (ko)', 'Commons category link is on Wikidata', 'Good articles', 'Grand Prize Golden Disc Award recipients', 'K-pop music groups', 'Korean Music Award winners', 'Melon Music Award winners', 'Mnet Asian Music Award winners', 'Musical groups established in 2006', 'Musical groups from Seoul', 'Musical quintets', 'Pages containing links to subscription-only content', 'South Korean boy bands', 'South Korean contemporary R&B musical groups', 'South Korean dance music groups', 'South Korean electronic musicians', 'South Korean hip hop groups', 'South Korean pop music groups', 'Universal Music Japan artists', 'Webarchive template wayback links', 'Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with MusicBrainz identifiers', 'Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages', 'YG Entertainment artists']","['Fantasy', 'Romance', 'Comedy']",KBS2,"18 years old Kang Kyung Joon (<a href=""http://star.koreandrama.org/?p=13689"" target=""_blank"">Shin Won Ho</a>)’s spirit suddenly becomes transplanted in the body of 30 years old Seo Yoon Jae (<a href=""http://star.koreandrama.org/?p=179"" target=""_blank"">Gong Yoo</a>).

1383,Mermaid Story,"In folklore, a mermaid is an aquatic creature with the head and upper body of a female human and the tail of a fish. Mermaids appear in the folklore of many cultures worldwide, including the Near East, Europe, Asia, and Africa. The first stories appeared in ancient Assyria, in which the goddess Atargatis transformed herself into a mermaid out of shame for accidentally killing her human lover. Mermaids are sometimes associated with perilous events such as floods, storms, shipwrecks, and drownings. In other folk traditions (or sometimes within the same tradition), they can be benevolent or beneficent, bestowing boons or falling in love with humans.
The male equivalent of the mermaid is the merman, also a familiar figure in folklore and heraldry.  Although traditions about and sightings of mermen are less common than those of mermaids, they are generally assumed to co-exist with their female counterparts.
Some of the attributes of mermaids may have been influenced by the Sirens of Greek mythology.  Historical accounts of mermaids, such as those reported by Christopher Columbus during his exploration of the Caribbean, may have been inspired by manatees and similar aquatic mammals.  While there is no evidence that mermaids exist outside folklore, reports of mermaid sightings continue to the present day, including 21st-century examples from Israel and Zimbabwe.
Mermaids have been a popular subject of art and literature in recent centuries, such as in Hans Christian Andersen's well-known fairy tale ""The Little Mermaid"" (1836). They have subsequently been depicted in operas, paintings, books, films and comics.","['All articles with dead external links', 'Articles containing Greek-language text', 'Articles containing Russian-language text', 'Articles with dead external links from June 2017', 'Articles with permanently dead external links', 'CS1: Julian–Gregorian uncertainty', 'CS1: long volume value', 'Good articles', 'Heraldic beasts', 'Human-headed mythical creatures', 'Medieval legends', 'Mermaids', 'Nereids', 'Water spirits', 'Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers', 'Wikipedia indefinitely move-protected pages']","['Drama', 'mystery']",tvN,"Lee Min Suk (<a href=""http://star.koreandrama.org/?p=99"" target=""_blank"">Kim Nam Jin</a>) falls in love with Son Mi Na (Lee Ji Hyun) but one day she suddenly disappears.

The group originally debuted with four members: Jun Hyoseong, Jung Hana, Song Jieun and Han Sunhwa. They released their debut single I Want You Back October 2009.

With the success of ""Magic"" and ""Madonna"", the group received the ""Newcomer Award"" at the 25th Golden Disk Awards. During Secret's early days the group was known as ""basement idols"" because of the poor living conditions they were in, but with their rapid success the group was able to move into better conditions.In 2011, Secret adopted a girl-next-door image through songs like Shy Boy and Starlight Moonlight which led the group to major success. With the hit single Shy Boy Secret won their first music show award on M Countdown; they also managed to stay at number one on Music Bank for three consecutive weeks, earning them a triple crown. Shy Boy and Starlight Moonlight won Secret multiple awards including two Song of the Year awards at the 1st Gaon Chart Awards for the months of January and June. Secret released their first full-length album Moving in Secret in October 2011, featuring the lead single ""Love is Move"" which showcased Secret's sexy and confident side again. With the group's success in South Korea throughout 2011, Secret sold over seven million in digital download sales.
In August of the same year, Secret made their Japanese debut releasing their first single, ""Madonna"", a remake of their Korean hit single, which debuted at number nine on the Oricon charts. In November 2011, ""Shy Boy"" was remade to serve as the lead single on their first Japanese mini album Shy Boy which also featured a Christmas remake of ""Starlight Moonlight"" titled ""Christmas Magic"". Throughout 2012, Secret heavily promoted in Japan releasing two Japanese singles, So Much For Goodbye and Twinkle Twinkle, prior to releasing their first full-length Japanese album, Welcome to Secret Time.

1389,Love Needs a Miracle,"South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (ROK), is a country in East Asia, constituting the southern part of the Korean Peninsula and lying to the east of the Asian mainland. The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time, ruling most of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia, under Gwanggaeto the Great. South Korea lies in the north temperate zone and has a predominantly mountainous terrain. It comprises an estimated 51.4 million residents distributed over 100,363 km2 (38,750 sq mi). Its capital and largest city is Seoul, with a population of around 10 million.
Archaeology indicates that the Korean Peninsula was inhabited by early humans starting from the Lower Paleolithic period (2.6 Ma–300 Ka). The history of Korea begins with the foundation of Gojoseon in 2333 BCE by the mythic king Dangun, but no archaeological evidence and writing was found from this period. The Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in 11th century BCE, and its existence and role has been controversial in the modern era. The written historical record on Gojoseon (Old Joseon) was first mentioned in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under Unified Silla in CE 668, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910). It was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. At the end of World War II, Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S. zones of occupations. A separate election was held in the U.S. zone in 1948 which led to the creation of the Republic of Korea (ROK), while the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was established in the Soviet zone. The United Nations at the time passed a resolution declaring the ROK to be the only lawful government in Korea.The Korean War began in June 1950 when forces from North Korea invaded South Korea. The war lasted three years and involved the U.S., China, the Soviet Union and several other nations. The border between the two nations remains the most heavily fortified in the world. Under long-time military leader Park Chung-hee, the South Korean economy grew significantly and the country was transformed into a G-20 major economy. Military rule ended in 1987, and the country is now a presidential republic consisting of 17 administrative divisions.
South Korea is a highly developed country and a high-income economy, with a ""very high"" Human Development Index, ranking 22nd in the world. The country is considered a regional power and is the world's 11th largest economy by nominal GDP and the 12th largest by PPP as of 2010. South Korea is a global leader in the industrial and technological sectors, being the world's 5th largest exporter and 8th largest importer. Its export-driven economy primarily focuses production on electronics, automobiles, ships, machinery, petrochemicals and robotics. South Korea is a member of the ASEAN Plus mechanism, the United Nations, Uniting for Consensus, G20, the WTO and OECD and is a founding member of APEC and the East Asia Summit.","['1948 establishments in South Korea', 'All Wikipedia articles in need of updating', 'All articles containing potentially dated statements', 'All articles with dead external links', 'All articles with self-published sources', 'All articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases', 'All articles with unsourced statements', 'Articles containing Korean-language text', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2005', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2010', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2016', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2018', 'Articles containing potentially dated statements from May 2009', 'Articles with Curlie links', 'Articles with French-language external links', 'Articles with Korean-language external links', 'Articles with dead external links from April 2017', 'Articles with dead external links from February 2009', 'Articles with dead external links from July 2017', 'Articles with hAudio microformats', 'Articles with obsolete information from March 2012', 'Articles with permanently dead external links', 'Articles with self-published sources from December 2017', 'Articles with short description', 'Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from May 2012', 'Articles with unsourced statements from June 2018', 'CS1 Chinese-language sources (zh)', 'CS1 Korean-language sources (ko)', 'CS1 maint: BOT: original-url status unknown', 'CS1 uses Chinese-language script (zh)', 'CS1 uses Korean-language script (ko)', 'Coordinates on Wikidata', 'East Asian countries', 'G20 nations', 'Korea', 'Korean-speaking countries and territories', 'Member states of the United Nations', 'Northeast Asian countries', 'Official website different in Wikidata and Wikipedia', 'Pages using infobox country or infobox former country with the symbol caption or type parameters', 'Republics', 'South Korea', 'States and territories established in 1948', 'Use mdy dates from November 2017', 'Webarchive template wayback links', 'Webarchive template webcite links', 'Wikipedia articles incorporating text from the World Factbook', 'Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with MusicBrainz area identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with WorldCat-VIAF identifiers', 'Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages']","['Drama', 'Romance', 'Comedy']",SBS,A single mother finds love.

1407,Blood,"Korean ethnic nationalism, or racial nationalism, is a political ideology and a form of ethnic (or racial) identity that is widely prevalent in modern North and South Korea. It is based on the belief that Koreans form a nation, a ""race"", and an ethnic group that shares a unified bloodline and a distinct culture. It is centered on the notion of the minjok (Hangul: 민족; Hanja: 民族), a term that had been coined in Imperial Japan (""minzoku"") in the early Meiji period on the basis of Social Darwinian conceptions. Minjok has been translated as ""nation"", ""people"", ""ethnic group"", ""race"", and ""race-nation"".This conception started to emerge among Korean intellectuals after the Japanese-imposed Protectorate of 1905, when the Japanese were trying to persuade Koreans that both nations were of the same racial stock. The notion of the Korean minjok was first made popular by essayist and historian Shin Chaeho in his New Reading of History (1908), a history of Korea from the mythical times of Dangun to the fall of Balhae in 926 CE. Shin portrayed the minjok as a warlike race that had fought bravely to preserve Korean identity, had later declined, and now needed to be reinvigorated. During the period of Japanese rule (1910–1945), this belief in the uniqueness of the Korean minjok gave an impetus for resisting Japanese assimilation policies and historical scholarship.In contrast to Japan and Germany, where such race-based conceptions of the nation were discredited after the Second World War because they were associated with ultranationalism or Nazism, postwar North and South Korea continued to proclaim their ethnic homogeneity and pure bloodline. In the 1960s, President Park Chung-hee strengthened this ""ideology of racial purity"" to legitimate his authoritarian rule, while in North Korea official propaganda has portrayed Koreans as ""the cleanest race."" Contemporary Korean historians continue to write about the nation's ""unique racial and cultural heritage."" This shared conception of a racially defined Korea continues to shape Korean politics and foreign relations, gives Koreans an impetus to national pride, and feeds hopes for the reunification of the two Koreas.Despite statistics showing that South Korea is becoming an increasingly multi-ethnic society, most of the South Korean population continues to identify itself as ""one people"" (Korean: 단일민족; Hanja: 單一民族, danil minjok) joined by a common ""bloodline"". A renewed emphasis on the purity of Korean ""blood"" has caused tensions, leading to renewed debates on multi-ethnicity and racism both in South Korea and abroad.In South Korea, Korean racial nationalism has been described as constituting a civic religion of sorts.","['All articles with vague or ambiguous time', 'Articles containing Korean-language text', 'CS1 maint: BOT: original-url status unknown', 'Cultural geography', 'Ethnic nationalism', 'Ethnocentrism', 'Korean nationalism', 'Racism in Asia', 'Sociology of culture', 'Vague or ambiguous time from January 2016', 'Webarchive template wayback links']","['Medical', 'Fantasy', 'Romance']",KBS2,"Park Ji Sang (<a href=""http://star.koreandrama.org/?p=35828"" target=""_blank"">Ahn Jae Hyun</a>) is a doctor specializing in “hepato-pancreato-biliary” surgery in the best cancer research hospital in the country.

The plot revolves around Darien Fawkes (Ventresca), a thief facing life imprisonment who is recruited by a spy agency that is constantly short on funds, and given the power of invisibility via implantation of a special ""Quicksilver gland"" in his head. The gland allows Fawkes to secrete a light-bending substance called ""Quicksilver"" from his pores and follicles. The substance quickly coats his skin, hair, nails, clothes, and whatever he is carrying, and renders him invisible. He can consciously release the Quicksilver, which then flakes off and disintegrates. However, the Quicksilver gland was sabotaged at its creation by scientist Arnaud DeFehrn to release a neurotoxin that accumulates in the bloodstream and causes intense pain, followed by antisocial behavior and psychosis. The host requires regular doses of ""counteragent"" to keep him sane and healthy, which is controlled by the government agency. This series lasted for two seasons, before being cancelled due to cost issues and internal bickering between the Sci Fi Channel and its then-parent company, USA Networks. The show's first season ran concurrently in first-run syndication as well as on Sci-Fi.
Despite its science fiction and action elements, the series' plot deals with a variety of adult themes such as freedom of choice, determinism, and state bureaucracy.","['2000 American television series debuts', '2000s American comic science fiction television series', '2002 American television series endings', 'Espionage television series', 'Fiction about invisibility', 'Syfy original programs', 'TV.com template with ID same as Wikidata', 'Television series by Universal Television', 'The Invisible Man', 'Use mdy dates from June 2013', 'Webarchive template wayback links']",['Drama'],KBS2,"An Alzheimer’s stricken detective Choi Jang Soo (Yoo Oh Sung) decides to do his best to make his family happy after he learns that he has little time left to live.

1431,How Much You Like It,"South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (ROK), is a country in East Asia, constituting the southern part of the Korean Peninsula and lying to the east of the Asian mainland. The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time, ruling most of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia, under Gwanggaeto the Great. South Korea lies in the north temperate zone and has a predominantly mountainous terrain. It comprises an estimated 51.4 million residents distributed over 100,363 km2 (38,750 sq mi). Its capital and largest city is Seoul, with a population of around 10 million.
Archaeology indicates that the Korean Peninsula was inhabited by early humans starting from the Lower Paleolithic period (2.6 Ma–300 Ka). The history of Korea begins with the foundation of Gojoseon in 2333 BCE by the mythic king Dangun, but no archaeological evidence and writing was found from this period. The Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in 11th century BCE, and its existence and role has been controversial in the modern era. The written historical record on Gojoseon (Old Joseon) was first mentioned in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under Unified Silla in CE 668, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910). It was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. At the end of World War II, Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S. zones of occupations. A separate election was held in the U.S. zone in 1948 which led to the creation of the Republic of Korea (ROK), while the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was established in the Soviet zone. The United Nations at the time passed a resolution declaring the ROK to be the only lawful government in Korea.The Korean War began in June 1950 when forces from North Korea invaded South Korea. The war lasted three years and involved the U.S., China, the Soviet Union and several other nations. The border between the two nations remains the most heavily fortified in the world. Under long-time military leader Park Chung-hee, the South Korean economy grew significantly and the country was transformed into a G-20 major economy. Military rule ended in 1987, and the country is now a presidential republic consisting of 17 administrative divisions.
South Korea is a highly developed country and a high-income economy, with a ""very high"" Human Development Index, ranking 22nd in the world. The country is considered a regional power and is the world's 11th largest economy by nominal GDP and the 12th largest by PPP as of 2010.

1439,"Genre: Drama, human, military, comedy","War film is a film genre concerned with warfare, typically about naval, air, or land battles, with combat scenes central to the drama. It has been strongly associated with the 20th century. The fateful nature of battle scenes means that war films often end with them. Themes explored include combat, survival and escape, camaraderie between soldiers, sacrifice, the futility and inhumanity of battle, the effects of war on society, and the moral and human issues raised by war. War films are often categorized by their milieu, such as the Korean War; the most popular subject is the Second World War. The stories told may be fiction, historical drama, or biographical. Critics have noted similarities between the Western and the war film.
Nations such as China, Indonesia, Japan, and Russia have their own traditions of war film, centred on their own revolutionary wars but taking varied forms, from action and historical drama to wartime romance.
Subgenres, not necessarily distinct, include anti-war, comedy, animated, propaganda, and documentary. There are similarly subgenres of the war film in specific theatres such as the western desert (North Africa), the Pacific in the Second World War, or Vietnam; and films set in specific domains of war, such as the infantry, the air, at sea, in submarines, or at prisoner of war camps.","['Articles containing Arabic-language text', 'Articles containing French-language text', 'Articles containing Italian-language text', 'Articles containing Russian-language text', 'Articles with short description', 'Documentary films about war', 'Film genres', 'Good articles', 'Interlanguage link template link number', 'Military fiction', 'War films', 'Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers', 'Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers', 'Works about wars']","['Drama', 'human', 'military', 'comedy']",tvN ,
